<summary class="article-expander__title">Vision Transformer Adapters for Generalizable Multitask Learning. (arXiv:2308.12372v1 [cs.CV])</summary>
<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12372">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>We introduce the first multitasking vision transformer adapters that learn
generalizable task affinities which can be applied to novel tasks and domains.
Integrated into an off-the-shelf vision transformer backbone, our adapters can
simultaneously solve multiple dense vision tasks in a parameter-efficient
manner, unlike existing multitasking transformers that are parametrically
expensive. In contrast to concurrent methods, we do not require retraining or
fine-tuning whenever a new task or domain is added. We introduce a task-adapted
attention mechanism within our adapter framework that combines gradient-based
task similarities with attention-based ones. The learned task affinities
generalize to the following settings: zero-shot task transfer, unsupervised
domain adaptation, and generalization without fine-tuning to novel domains. We
demonstrate that our approach outperforms not only the existing convolutional
neural network-based multitasking methods but also the vision transformer-based
ones. Our project page is at \url{https://ivrl.github.io/VTAGML}.

<span><p>A person's gender is a crucial piece of information when performing research
across a wide range of scientific disciplines, such as medicine, sociology,
political science, and economics, to name a few. However, in increasing
instances, especially given the proliferation of big data, gender information
is not readily available. In such cases researchers need to infer gender from
readily available information, primarily from persons' names. While inferring
gender from name may raise some ethical questions, the lack of viable
alternatives means that researchers have to resort to such approaches when the
goal justifies the means - in the majority of such studies the goal is to
examine patterns and determinants of gender disparities. The necessity of
name-to-gender inference has generated an ever-growing domain of algorithmic
approaches and software products. These approaches have been used throughout
the world in academia, industry, governmental and non-governmental
organizations. Nevertheless, the existing approaches have yet to be
systematically evaluated and compared, making it challenging to determine the
optimal approach for future research. In this work, we conducted a large scale
performance evaluation of existing approaches for name-to-gender inference.
Analysis are performed using a variety of large annotated datasets of names. We
further propose two new hybrid approaches that achieve better performance than
any single existing approach.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12383">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Image captioning, like many tasks involving vision and language, currently
relies on Transformer-based architectures for extracting the semantics in an
image and translating it into linguistically coherent descriptions. Although
successful, the attention operator only considers a weighted summation of
projections of the current input sample, therefore ignoring the relevant
semantic information which can come from the joint observation of other
samples. In this paper, we devise a network which can perform attention over
activations obtained while processing other training samples, through a
prototypical memory model. Our memory models the distribution of past keys and
values through the definition of prototype vectors which are both
discriminative and compact. Experimentally, we assess the performance of the
proposed model on the COCO dataset, in comparison with carefully designed
baselines and state-of-the-art approaches, and by investigating the role of
each of the proposed components. We demonstrate that our proposal can increase
the performance of an encoder-decoder Transformer by 3.7 CIDEr points both when
training in cross-entropy only and when fine-tuning with self-critical sequence
training. Source code and trained models are available at:

<span><p>Sign language, which conveys meaning through gestures, is the chief means of
communication among deaf people. Recognizing sign language in natural settings
presents significant challenges due to factors such as lighting, background
clutter, and variations in signer characteristics. In this thesis, I study
automatic sign language processing in the wild, using signing videos collected
from the Internet. This thesis contributes new datasets, tasks, and methods.
Most chapters of this thesis address tasks related to fingerspelling, an
important component of sign language and yet has not been studied widely by
prior work. I present three new large-scale ASL datasets in the wild:
ChicagoFSWild, ChicagoFSWild+, and OpenASL. Using ChicagoFSWild and
ChicagoFSWild+, I address fingerspelling recognition, which consists of
transcribing fingerspelling sequences into text. I propose an end-to-end
approach based on iterative attention that allows recognition from a raw video
without explicit hand detection. I further show that using a Conformer-based
network jointly modeling handshape and mouthing can bring performance close to
that of humans. Next, I propose two tasks for building real-world
fingerspelling-based applications: fingerspelling detection and search. For
fingerspelling detection, I introduce a suite of evaluation metrics and a new
detection model via multi-task training. To address the problem of searching
for fingerspelled keywords in raw sign language videos, we propose a novel
method that jointly localizes and matches fingerspelling segments to text.
Finally, I will describe a benchmark for large-vocabulary open-domain sign
language translation based on OpenASL. To address the challenges of sign
language translation in realistic settings, we propose a set of techniques
including sign search as a pretext task for pre-training and fusion of mouthing
and handshape features.

under uncertainty and incomplete information. In this paper, we put ChatGPT and
GPT-4 through the poker test and evaluate their poker skills. Our findings
reveal that while both models display an advanced understanding of poker,
encompassing concepts like the valuation of starting hands, playing positions

<p>Through a series of experiments, we first discover the characteristics of
optimal prompts and model parameters for playing poker with these models. Our
observations then unveil the distinct playing personas of the two models. We
first conclude that GPT-4 is a more advanced poker player than ChatGPT. This
exploration then sheds light on the divergent poker tactics of the two models:
ChatGPT's conservativeness juxtaposed against GPT-4's aggression. In poker
vernacular, when tasked to play GTO poker, ChatGPT plays like a Nit, which
means that it has a propensity to only engage with premium hands and folds a
majority of hands. When subjected to the same directive, GPT-4 plays like a

<span><p>As language models (LMs) become increasingly powerful, it is important to

Prior bias measurement datasets are sensitive to perturbations in their
manually designed templates, therefore unreliable. To achieve reliability, we
introduce the Comprehensive Assessment of Language Model bias (CALM), a
benchmark dataset to quantify bias in LMs across three tasks. We integrate 16
existing datasets across different domains, such as Wikipedia and news
articles, to filter 224 templates from which we construct a dataset of 78,400
examples. We compare the diversity of CALM with prior datasets on metrics such
as average semantic similarity, and variation in template length, and test the
sensitivity to small perturbations. We show that our dataset is more diverse
and reliable than previous datasets, thus better capture the breadth of
linguistic variation required to reliably evaluate model bias. We evaluate 20
large language models including six prominent families of LMs such as Llama-2.
In two LM series, OPT and Bloom, we found that larger parameter models are more
biased than lower parameter models. We found the T0 series of models to be the
least biased. Furthermore, we noticed a tradeoff between gender and racial bias

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12578">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recent researches indicate that Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)
possess cognitive constructs similar to those observed in humans, prompting
researchers to investigate the cognitive aspects of LLMs. This paper focuses on
explicit and implicit social bias, a distinctive two-level cognitive construct
in psychology. It posits that individuals' explicit social bias, which is their
conscious expression of bias in the statements, may differ from their implicit
social bias, which represents their unconscious bias. We propose a two-stage
approach and discover a parallel phenomenon in LLMs known as "re-judge
inconsistency" in social bias. In the initial stage, the LLM is tasked with
automatically completing statements, potentially incorporating implicit social
bias. However, in the subsequent stage, the same LLM re-judges the biased
statement generated by itself but contradicts it. We propose that this re-judge
inconsistency can be similar to the inconsistency between human's unaware
implicit social bias and their aware explicit social bias. Experimental
investigations on ChatGPT and GPT-4 concerning common gender biases examined in
psychology corroborate the highly stable nature of the re-judge inconsistency.
This finding may suggest that diverse cognitive constructs emerge as LLMs'
capabilities strengthen. Consequently, leveraging psychological theories can
provide enhanced insights into the underlying mechanisms governing the
expressions of explicit and implicit constructs in LLMs.

<span><p>Automatic medical report generation (MRG) is of great research value as it
has the potential to relieve radiologists from the heavy burden of report
writing. Despite recent advancements, accurate MRG remains challenging due to
the need for precise clinical understanding and the identification of clinical
findings. Moreover, the imbalanced distribution of diseases makes the challenge
even more pronounced, as rare diseases are underrepresented in training data,
making their diagnostic performance unreliable. To address these challenges, we
propose diagnosis-driven prompts for medical report generation (PromptMRG), a
novel framework that aims to improve the diagnostic accuracy of MRG with the
guidance of diagnosis-aware prompts. Specifically, PromptMRG is based on
encoder-decoder architecture with an extra disease classification branch. When
generating reports, the diagnostic results from the classification branch are
converted into token prompts to explicitly guide the generation process. To
further improve the diagnostic accuracy, we design cross-modal feature
enhancement, which retrieves similar reports from the database to assist the
diagnosis of a query image by leveraging the knowledge from a pre-trained CLIP.
Moreover, the disease imbalanced issue is addressed by applying an adaptive
logit-adjusted loss to the classification branch based on the individual
learning status of each disease, which overcomes the barrier of text decoder's
inability to manipulate disease distributions. Experiments on two MRG
benchmarks show the effectiveness of the proposed method, where it obtains

as the probability of an affix to combine with a random base. The advantages of
this approach include the following. First, token frequency does not dominate
the productivity measure but naturally influences the sampling of bases.
Second, we are not just counting attested word types with an affix but rather
simulating the construction of these types and then checking whether they are
attested in the corpus. Third, a corpus-based approach and randomised design
assure that true neologisms and words coined long ago have equal chances to be
selected. The proposed algorithm is evaluated both on English and Russian data.
The obtained results provide some valuable insights into the relation of
linguistic productivity to the number of types and tokens. It looks like
burgeoning linguistic productivity manifests itself in an increasing number of

(ToDs) results in suboptimal performance as these models overlook key features

paper, we propose a framework that turns a chit-chat ERC model into a

multi-aspect emotion definition in ToDs to devise a multi-task learning

yields significant improvements for a range of chit-chat ERC models on EmoWOZ,
a large-scale dataset for user emotion in ToDs. We further investigate the

<span><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) present strong general capabilities, and a

limitations on local focus, LLMs tend to focus more on the words or sentences

OVERMISS. SWIE improves the model instruction understanding by adding a global

OVERMISS improves model faithfulness by comparing over-translation and

<span><p>Instruction tuning is instrumental in enabling Large Language Models~(LLMs)
to follow user instructions to complete various open-domain tasks. The success
of instruction tuning depends on the availability of high-quality instruction
data. Owing to the exorbitant cost and substandard quality of human annotation,
recent works have been deeply engaged in the exploration of the utilization of
powerful closed-source models to generate instruction data automatically.
However, these methods carry potential risks arising from the usage
requirements of powerful closed-source models, which strictly forbid the
utilization of their outputs to develop machine learning models. To deal with
this problem, in this work, we explore alternative approaches to generate
high-quality instruction data that do not rely on closed-source models. Our
exploration includes an investigation of various existing instruction
generation methods, culminating in the integration of the most efficient
variant with two novel strategies to enhance the quality further. Evaluation
results from two benchmarks and the GPT-4 model demonstrate the effectiveness
of our generated instruction data, which can outperform Alpaca, a method
reliant on closed-source models. We hope that more progress can be achieved in
generating high-quality instruction data without using closed-source models.

<span><p>There are growing implications surrounding generative AI in the speech domain
that enable voice cloning and real-time voice conversion from one individual to

breaches of privacy and misrepresentation, thus there is an urgent need for
real-time detection of AI-generated speech for DeepFake Voice Conversion. To
address the above emerging issues, the DEEP-VOICE dataset is generated in this
study, comprised of real human speech from eight well-known figures and their
speech converted to one another using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion.
Presenting as a binary classification problem of whether the speech is real or
AI-generated, statistical analysis of temporal audio features through t-testing
reveals that there are significantly different distributions. Hyperparameter
optimisation is implemented for machine learning models to identify the source
of speech. Following the training of 208 individual machine learning models
over 10-fold cross validation, it is found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting
model can achieve an average classification accuracy of 99.3% and can classify
speech in real-time, at around 0.004 milliseconds given one second of speech.
All data generated for this study is released publicly for future research on

Unlike the conventional approach of solely relying on passive methods for
detecting synthetic data, watermarking presents a proactive and robust defence
mechanism against these looming risks. This paper introduces an innovative
audio watermarking framework that encodes up to 32 bits of watermark within a
mere 1-second audio snippet. The watermark is imperceptible to human senses and
exhibits strong resilience against various attacks. It can serve as an
effective identifier for synthesized voices and holds potential for broader
applications in audio copyright protection. Moreover, this framework boasts
high flexibility, allowing for the combination of multiple watermark segments
to achieve heightened robustness and expanded capacity. Utilizing 10 to
20-second audio as the host, our approach demonstrates an average Bit Error

<span><p>The mainstream of data-driven abstractive summarization models tends to
explore the correlations rather than the causal relationships. Among such
correlations, there can be spurious ones which suffer from the language prior

effectiveness of the learned model. To tackle this issue, we introduce a
Structural Causal Model (SCM) to induce the underlying causal structure of the
summarization data. We assume several latent causal factors and non-causal
factors, representing the content and style of the document and summary.
Theoretically, we prove that the latent factors in our SCM can be identified by
fitting the observed training data under certain conditions. On the basis of
this, we propose a Causality Inspired Sequence-to-Sequence model (CI-Seq2Seq)
to learn the causal representations that can mimic the causal factors, guiding
us to pursue causal information for summary generation. The key idea is to
reformulate the Variational Auto-encoder (VAE) to fit the joint distribution of

<span><p>The emergence of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) emphasizes the need
for accurate and efficient prompting approaches. LLMs are often applied in
Few-Shot Learning (FSL) contexts, where tasks are executed with minimal
training data. FSL has become popular in many Artificial Intelligence (AI)
subdomains, including AI for health. Rare diseases, affecting a small fraction
of the population, inherently require FSL techniques due to limited data
availability, though manual data collection and annotation is costly and
time-consuming. In this paper, we propose Models-Vote Prompting (MVP), a
flexible prompting approach for improving the performance of LLM queries in FSL
settings. MVP works by prompting numerous LLMs to perform the same tasks and
then conducting a majority vote on the resulting outputs. This method achieves
improved results to any one model in the ensemble on one-shot rare disease
identification and classification tasks. We also release a novel rare disease
dataset for FSL, available to those who agreed to the MIMIC-IV Data Use

deploying these models in practice is the challenge of helping practitioners

descriptions of the optimization model itself, identify potential sources of
infeasibility, and offer suggestions to make the model feasible. The
implementation of OptiChat is built on GPT-4, which interfaces with an
optimization solver to identify the minimal subset of constraints that render
the entire optimization problem infeasible, also known as the Irreducible

Previous models cannot make a distinction between ``An astronaut rides a horse"

Firstly, we use scene graphs to guide the construction of semantic negative

<span><p>A diversity of tasks use language models trained on semantic similarity data.
While there are a variety of datasets that capture semantic similarity, they
are either constructed from modern web data or are relatively small datasets
created in the past decade by human annotators. This study utilizes a novel
source, newly digitized articles from off-copyright, local U.S. newspapers, to
assemble a massive-scale semantic similarity dataset spanning 70 years from
1920 to 1989 and containing nearly 400M positive semantic similarity pairs.
Historically, around half of articles in U.S. local newspapers came from
newswires like the Associated Press. While local papers reproduced articles
from the newswire, they wrote their own headlines, which form abstractive
summaries of the associated articles. We associate articles and their headlines
by exploiting document layouts and language understanding. We then use deep
neural methods to detect which articles are from the same underlying source, in
the presence of substantial noise and abridgement. The headlines of reproduced
articles form positive semantic similarity pairs. The resulting publicly
available HEADLINES dataset is significantly larger than most existing semantic
similarity datasets and covers a much longer span of time. It will facilitate
the application of contrastively trained semantic similarity models to a
variety of tasks, including the study of semantic change across space and time.

<span><p>The emergence of large-scale pre-trained language models, such as ChatGPT,
has revolutionized various research fields in artificial intelligence.
Transformers-based large language models (LLMs) have gradually replaced CNNs
and RNNs to unify fields of computer vision and natural language processing.
Compared with the data that exists relatively independently such as images,
videos or texts, graph is a type of data that contains rich structural and
relational information. Meanwhile, natural language, as one of the most
expressive mediums, excels in describing complex structures. However, existing
work on incorporating graph learning problems into the generative language
modeling framework remains very limited. As the importance of large language
models continues to grow, it becomes essential to explore whether LLMs can also
replace GNNs as the foundation model for graphs. In this paper, we propose
InstructGLM (Instruction-finetuned Graph Language Model), systematically design
highly scalable prompts based on natural language instructions, and use natural
language to describe the geometric structure and node features of the graph for
instruction tuning an LLM to perform learning and inference on graphs in a
generative manner. Our method exceeds all competitive GNN baselines on
ogbn-arxiv, Cora and PubMed datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of
our method and sheds light on generative large language models as the
foundation model for graph machine learning.

<span><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are becoming increasingly
sophisticated, demonstrating capabilities that closely resemble those of
humans. These AI models are playing an essential role in assisting humans with
a wide array of tasks in daily life. A significant application of AI is its use
as a chat agent, responding to human inquiries across various domains. Current
LLMs have shown proficiency in answering general questions. However, basic
question-answering dialogue often falls short in complex diagnostic scenarios,
such as legal or medical consultations. These scenarios typically necessitate
Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD), wherein an AI chat agent needs to proactively
pose questions and guide users towards specific task completion. Previous
fine-tuning models have underperformed in TOD, and current LLMs do not
inherently possess this capability. In this paper, we introduce DiagGPT
(Dialogue in Diagnosis GPT), an innovative method that extends LLMs to TOD
scenarios. Our experiments reveal that DiagGPT exhibits outstanding performance
in conducting TOD with users, demonstrating its potential for practical
applications.

<span><p>What does it take to create the Babel Fish, a tool that can help individuals
translate speech between any two languages? While recent breakthroughs in
text-based models have pushed machine translation coverage beyond 200
languages, unified speech-to-speech translation models have yet to achieve
similar strides. More specifically, conventional speech-to-speech translation
systems rely on cascaded systems that perform translation progressively,
putting high-performing unified systems out of reach. To address these gaps, we
introduce SeamlessM4T, a single model that supports speech-to-speech
translation, speech-to-text translation, text-to-speech translation,
text-to-text translation, and automatic speech recognition for up to 100
languages. To build this, we used 1 million hours of open speech audio data to
learn self-supervised speech representations with w2v-BERT 2.0. Subsequently,
we created a multimodal corpus of automatically aligned speech translations.
Filtered and combined with human-labeled and pseudo-labeled data, we developed
the first multilingual system capable of translating from and into English for
both speech and text. On FLEURS, SeamlessM4T sets a new standard for
translations into multiple target languages, achieving an improvement of 20%
BLEU over the previous SOTA in direct speech-to-text translation. Compared to
strong cascaded models, SeamlessM4T improves the quality of into-English
translation by 1.3 BLEU points in speech-to-text and by 2.6 ASR-BLEU points in
speech-to-speech. Tested for robustness, our system performs better against
background noises and speaker variations in speech-to-text tasks compared to
the current SOTA model. Critically, we evaluated SeamlessM4T on gender bias and
added toxicity to assess translation safety. Finally, all contributions in this
work are open-sourced and accessible at

<span><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Although convenient for research and practical applications, open-source
LLMs with fewer parameters often suffer from severe hallucinations compared to
their larger counterparts. This paper focuses on measuring and reducing
hallucinations in BLOOM 7B, a representative of such weaker open-source LLMs
that are publicly available for research and commercial applications. We
introduce HaloCheck, a lightweight BlackBox knowledge-free framework designed
to quantify the severity of hallucinations in LLMs. Additionally, we explore
techniques like knowledge injection and teacher-student approaches to alleviate
hallucinations in low-parameter LLMs. Our experiments effectively demonstrate
the reduction of hallucinations in challenging domains for these LLMs.
