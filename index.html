<span><p>Amidst the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, the convergence of
visual and textual information has surfaced as a crucial frontier, leading to
the advent of image-text multimodal models. This paper provides a comprehensive
review of the evolution and current state of image-text multimodal models,
exploring their application value, challenges, and potential research
trajectories. Initially, we revisit the basic concepts and developmental
milestones of these models, introducing a novel classification that segments
their evolution into three distinct phases, based on their time of introduction
and subsequent impact on the discipline. Furthermore, based on the tasks'
significance and prevalence in the academic landscape, we propose a
categorization of the tasks associated with image-text multimodal models into
five major types, elucidating the recent progress and key technologies within
each category. Despite the remarkable accomplishments of these models, numerous
challenges and issues persist. This paper delves into the inherent challenges
and limitations of image-text multimodal models, fostering the exploration of
prospective research directions. Our objective is to offer an exhaustive
overview of the present research landscape of image-text multimodal models and
to serve as a valuable reference for future scholarly endeavors. We extend an
invitation to the broader community to collaborate in enhancing the image-text
multimodal model community, accessible at:

<span><p>In today's interconnected globe, moving abroad is more and more prevalent,
whether it's for employment, refugee resettlement, or other causes. Language
difficulties between natives and immigrants present a common issue on a daily
basis, especially in medical domain. This can make it difficult for patients
and doctors to communicate during anamnesis or in the emergency room, which
compromises patient care. The goal of the HYKIST Project is to develop a speech
translation system to support patient-doctor communication with ASR and MT.
</p>
<p>ASR systems have recently displayed astounding performance on particular
tasks for which enough quantities of training data are available, such as
LibriSpeech. Building a good model is still difficult due to a variety of
speaking styles, acoustic and recording settings, and a lack of in-domain
training data. In this thesis, we describe our efforts to construct ASR systems
for a conversational telephone speech recognition task in the medical domain
for Vietnamese language to assist emergency room contact between doctors and
patients across linguistic barriers. In order to enhance the system's
performance, we investigate various training schedules and data combining
strategies. We also examine how best to make use of the little data that is
available. The use of publicly accessible models like XLSR-53 is compared to
the use of customized pre-trained models, and both supervised and unsupervised
approaches are utilized using wav2vec 2.0 as architecture.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15991">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Artificial neural networks typically struggle in generalizing to
out-of-context examples. One reason for this limitation is caused by having
datasets that incorporate only partial information regarding the potential
correlational structure of the world. In this work, we propose TIDA (Targeted
Image-editing Data Augmentation), a targeted data augmentation method focused
on improving models' human-like abilities (e.g., gender recognition) by filling
the correlational structure gap using a text-to-image generative model. More
specifically, TIDA identifies specific skills in captions describing images
(e.g., the presence of a specific gender in the image), changes the caption
(e.g., "woman" to "man"), and then uses a text-to-image model to edit the image
in order to match the novel caption (e.g., uniquely changing a woman to a man
while maintaining the context identical). Based on the Flickr30K benchmark, we
show that, compared with the original data set, a TIDA-enhanced dataset related
to gender, color, and counting abilities induces better performance in several
image captioning metrics. Furthermore, on top of relying on the classical BLEU
metric, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of the improvements of our models
against the baseline in different ways. We compared text-to-image generative
models and found different behaviors of the image captioning models in terms of
encoding visual encoding and textual decoding.

<span><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), although powerful in general domains, often
perform poorly on domain-specific tasks like medical question answering (QA).
Moreover, they tend to function as "black-boxes," making it challenging to

utilizing in-context learning, aiming to improve LLM responses without the need
for fine-tuning or retraining. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive
retrieval strategy to extract medical facts from an external knowledge base,
and then we incorporate them into the query prompt for the LLM. Focusing on
medical QA using the MedQA-SMILE dataset, we evaluate the impact of different
retrieval models and the number of facts provided to the LLM. Notably, our
edited Vicuna model exhibited an accuracy improvement from 44.46% to 48.54%.
This work underscores the potential of model editing to enhance LLM

windows of up to 32,768 tokens. Our model series are built through continual
pretraining from Llama 2 with longer training sequences and on a dataset where
long texts are upsampled. We perform extensive evaluation on language modeling,
synthetic context probing tasks, and a wide range of research benchmarks. On
research benchmarks, our models achieve consistent improvements on most regular
tasks and significant improvements on long-context tasks over Llama 2. Notably,
with a cost-effective instruction tuning procedure that does not require
human-annotated long instruction data, the 70B variant can already surpass
gpt-3.5-turbo-16k's overall performance on a suite of long-context tasks.
Alongside these results, we provide an in-depth analysis on the individual
components of our method. We delve into Llama's position encodings and discuss
its limitation in modeling long dependencies. We also examine the impact of
various design choices in the pretraining process, including the data mix and
the training curriculum of sequence lengths -- our ablation experiments suggest
that having abundant long texts in the pretrain dataset is not the key to
achieving strong performance, and we empirically verify that long context
continual pretraining is more efficient and similarly effective compared to
pretraining from scratch with long sequences.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16042">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Mechanistic interpretability seeks to understand the internal mechanisms of
machine learning models, where localization -- identifying the important model
components -- is a key step. Activation patching, also known as causal tracing
or interchange intervention, is a standard technique for this task (Vig et al.,
2020), but the literature contains many variants with little consensus on the
choice of hyperparameters or methodology. In this work, we systematically
examine the impact of methodological details in activation patching, including
evaluation metrics and corruption methods. In several settings of localization
and circuit discovery in language models, we find that varying these
hyperparameters could lead to disparate interpretability results. Backed by
empirical observations, we give conceptual arguments for why certain metrics or
methods may be preferred. Finally, we provide recommendations for the best
practices of activation patching going forwards.

individuals would like to practice their rights to be forgotten is
computationally expensive. We employ a teacher-student framework and propose a
novel leave-one-out ensemble method to unlearn the targeted textual sequences

are trained on disjoint sets; for each targeted sequence to be removed, we
exclude the teacher trained on the set containing this sequence and aggregate

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16090">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
planning the use of various functional tools, such as calculators and
retrievers, particularly in question-answering tasks. In this paper, we expand
the definition of these tools, centering on conceptual tools within the context
of dialogue systems. A conceptual tool specifies a cognitive concept that aids
systematic or investigative thought. These conceptual tools play important
roles in practice, such as multiple psychological or tutoring strategies being
dynamically applied in a single turn to compose helpful responses. To further
enhance the reasoning and planning capability of LLMs with these conceptual
tools, we introduce a multi-persona collaboration framework: Think-Plan-Execute
(TPE). This framework decouples the response generation process into three
distinct roles: Thinker, Planner, and Executor. Specifically, the Thinker
analyzes the internal status exhibited in the dialogue context, such as user
emotions and preferences, to formulate a global guideline. The Planner then
generates executable plans to call different conceptual tools (e.g., sources or
strategies), while the Executor compiles all intermediate results into a
coherent response. This structured approach not only enhances the
explainability and controllability of responses but also reduces token
redundancy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE across various dialogue
response generation tasks, including multi-source (FoCus) and multi-strategy
interactions (CIMA and PsyQA). This reveals its potential to handle real-world
dialogue interactions that require more complicated tool learning beyond just
functional tools. The full code and data will be released for reproduction.

<span><p>Standard practice within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
involves optimizing against a Reward Model (RM), which itself is trained to
reflect human preferences for desirable generations. A notable subject that is
understudied is the (in-)consistency of RMs -- whether they can recognize the
semantic changes to different prompts and appropriately adapt their reward
assignments -- and their impact on the downstream RLHF model.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we visit a series of research questions relevant to RM
inconsistency: (1) How can we measure the consistency of reward models? (2) How
consistent are the existing RMs and how can we improve them? (3) In what ways
does reward inconsistency influence the chatbots resulting from the RLHF model
training?
</p>
<p>We propose Contrast Instructions -- a benchmarking strategy for the
consistency of RM. Each example in Contrast Instructions features a pair of
lexically similar instructions with different ground truth responses. A
consistent RM is expected to rank the corresponding instruction and response
higher than other combinations. We observe that current RMs trained with the
standard ranking objective fail miserably on Contrast Instructions compared to
average humans. To show that RM consistency can be improved efficiently without
using extra training budget, we propose two techniques ConvexDA and
RewardFusion, which enhance reward consistency through extrapolation during the
RM training and inference stage, respectively. We show that RLHF models trained
with a more consistent RM yield more useful responses, suggesting that reward
inconsistency exhibits a trickle-down effect on the downstream RLHF process.

with modern architectures can be competitive. We build parsers combining

<span><p>Social media plays a significant role in boosting the fashion industry, where
a massive amount of fashion-related posts are generated every day. In order to
obtain the rich fashion information from the posts, we study the task of social
media fashion knowledge extraction. Fashion knowledge, which typically consists
of the occasion, person attributes, and fashion item information, can be
effectively represented as a set of tuples. Most previous studies on fashion
knowledge extraction are based on the fashion product images without
considering the rich text information in social media posts. Existing work on
fashion knowledge extraction in social media is classification-based and
requires to manually determine a set of fashion knowledge categories in
advance. In our work, we propose to cast the task as a captioning problem to
capture the interplay of the multimodal post information. Specifically, we
transform the fashion knowledge tuples into a natural language caption with a
sentence transformation method. Our framework then aims to generate the
sentence-based fashion knowledge directly from the social media post. Inspired
by the big success of pre-trained models, we build our model based on a
multimodal pre-trained generative model and design several auxiliary tasks for
enhancing the knowledge extraction. Since there is no existing dataset which
can be directly borrowed to our task, we introduce a dataset consisting of
social media posts with manual fashion knowledge annotation. Extensive
experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

(SCORER) network. Concretely, we first design a multi-head token-wise matching
to model relationships between cross-view features from similar/dissimilar

images, SCORER learns two view-invariant image representations in a
self-supervised way. Based on these, we reconstruct the representations of
unchanged objects by cross-attention, thus learning a stable difference
representation for caption generation. Further, we devise a cross-modal
backward reasoning to improve the quality of caption. This module reversely
models a ``hallucination'' representation with the caption and ``before''
representation. By pushing it closer to the ``after'' representation, we
enforce the caption to be informative about the difference in a self-supervised

aspects. However, when applying them to the highly specialized, safe-critical
legal domain, it is unclear how much legal knowledge they possess and whether
they can reliably perform legal-related tasks. To address this gap, we propose
a comprehensive evaluation benchmark LawBench. LawBench has been meticulously
crafted to have precise assessment of the LLMs' legal capabilities from three
cognitive levels: (1) Legal knowledge memorization: whether LLMs can memorize
needed legal concepts, articles and facts; (2) Legal knowledge understanding:
whether LLMs can comprehend entities, events and relationships within legal
text; (3) Legal knowledge applying: whether LLMs can properly utilize their
legal knowledge and make necessary reasoning steps to solve realistic legal
tasks. LawBench contains 20 diverse tasks covering 5 task types: single-label
classification (SLC), multi-label classification (MLC), regression, extraction
and generation. We perform extensive evaluations of 51 LLMs on LawBench,
including 20 multilingual LLMs, 22 Chinese-oriented LLMs and 9 legal specific
LLMs. The results show that GPT-4 remains the best-performing LLM in the legal
domain, surpassing the others by a significant margin. While fine-tuning LLMs
on legal specific text brings certain improvements, we are still a long way

to explicitly model hierarchical syntactic structures of raw texts without
relying on gold trees during both learning and inference. Existing research
along this line restricts data to follow a hierarchical tree structure and thus
lacks inter-span communications. To overcome the problem, we propose a novel
contextual inside-outside (CIO) layer that learns contextualized
representations of spans through bottom-up and top-down passes, where a
bottom-up pass forms representations of high-level spans by composing low-level
spans, while a top-down pass combines information inside and outside a span. By
stacking several CIO layers between the embedding layer and the attention
layers in Transformer, the ReCAT model can perform both deep intra-span and
deep inter-span interactions, and thus generate multi-grained representations
fully contextualized with other spans. Moreover, the CIO layers can be jointly
pre-trained with Transformers, making ReCAT enjoy scaling ability, strong
performance, and interpretability at the same time. We conduct experiments on
various sentence-level and span-level tasks. Evaluation results indicate that
ReCAT can significantly outperform vanilla Transformer models on all span-level
tasks and baselines that combine recursive networks with Transformers on
natural language inference tasks. More interestingly, the hierarchical
structures induced by ReCAT exhibit strong consistency with human-annotated

fully captures a range of crucial error criteria. We find that while preference
scores have fairly good coverage, they under-represent important aspects like
factuality. We further hypothesise that both preference scores and error
annotation may be affected by confounders, and leverage instruction-tuned

assertiveness and complexity. We find that the assertiveness of an output skews
the perceived rate of factuality errors, indicating that human annotations are
not a fully reliable evaluation metric or training objective. Finally, we offer
preliminary evidence that using human feedback as a training objective
disproportionately increases the assertiveness of model outputs. We encourage

<span><p>Despite considerable advances in automated fake news detection, due to the
timely nature of news, it remains a critical open question how to effectively
predict the veracity of news articles based on limited fact-checks. Existing
approaches typically follow a "Train-from-Scratch" paradigm, which is
fundamentally bounded by the availability of large-scale annotated data. While
expressive pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been adapted in a
"Pre-Train-and-Fine-Tune" manner, the inconsistency between pre-training and

paper, we propose "Prompt-and-Align" (P&amp;A), a novel prompt-based paradigm for
few-shot fake news detection that jointly leverages the pre-trained knowledge
in PLMs and the social context topology. Our approach mitigates label scarcity
by wrapping the news article in a task-related textual prompt, which is then
processed by the PLM to directly elicit task-specific knowledge. To supplement
the PLM with social context without inducing additional training overheads,
motivated by empirical observation on user veracity consistency (i.e., social
users tend to consume news of the same veracity type), we further construct a
news proximity graph among news articles to capture the veracity-consistent
signals in shared readerships, and align the prompting predictions along the
graph edges in a confidence-informed manner. Extensive experiments on three

Additionally, the challenges of providing provenance for model decisions and
maintaining up-to-date world knowledge persist as open research frontiers. To
address these limitations, the integration of pre-trained models with
differentiable access mechanisms to explicit non-parametric memory emerges as a
promising solution. This survey delves into the realm of language models (LMs)
augmented with the ability to tap into external knowledge sources, including
external knowledge bases and search engines. While adhering to the standard
objective of predicting missing tokens, these augmented LMs leverage diverse,

framing is novel in that it asks a model to learn a language from a single

that baselines using current LLMs are promising but fall short of human

<summary class="article-expander__title">Unlikelihood Tuning on Negative Samples Amazingly Improves Zero-Shot Translation. (arXiv:2309.16599v1 [cs.CL])</summary>
<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16599">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Zero-shot translation (ZST), which is generally based on a multilingual
neural machine translation model, aims to translate between unseen language
pairs in training data. The common practice to guide the zero-shot language
mapping during inference is to deliberately insert the source and target
language IDs, e.g., &lt;EN&gt; for English and &lt;DE&gt; for German. Recent studies have
shown that language IDs sometimes fail to navigate the ZST task, making them
suffer from the off-target problem (non-target language words exist in the
generated translation) and, therefore, difficult to apply the current
multilingual translation model to a broad range of zero-shot language
scenarios. To understand when and why the navigation capabilities of language
IDs are weakened, we compare two extreme decoder input cases in the ZST
directions: Off-Target (OFF) and On-Target (ON) cases. By contrastively
visualizing the contextual word representations (CWRs) of these cases with
teacher forcing, we show that 1) the CWRs of different languages are
effectively distributed in separate regions when the sentence and ID are
matched (ON setting), and 2) if the sentence and ID are unmatched (OFF
setting), the CWRs of different languages are chaotically distributed. Our
analyses suggest that although they work well in ideal ON settings, language
IDs become fragile and lose their navigation ability when faced with off-target
tokens, which commonly exist during inference but are rare in training
scenarios. In response, we employ unlikelihood tuning on the negative (OFF)
samples to minimize their probability such that the language IDs can
discriminate between the on- and off-target tokens during training. Experiments
spanning 40 ZST directions show that our method reduces the off-target ratio by
-48.0% on average, leading to a +9.1 BLEU improvement with only an extra +0.3%
tuning cost.

<span><p>Lemmatization is a natural language processing (NLP) task which consists of
producing, from a given inflected word, its canonical form or lemma.
Lemmatization is one of the basic tasks that facilitate downstream NLP
applications, and is of particular importance for high-inflected languages.
Given that the process to obtain a lemma from an inflected word can be
explained by looking at its morphosyntactic category, including fine-grained
morphosyntactic information to train contextual lemmatizers has become common
practice, without considering whether that is the optimum in terms of
downstream performance. In order to address this issue, in this paper we
empirically investigate the role of morphological information to develop
contextual lemmatizers in six languages within a varied spectrum of
morphological complexity: Basque, Turkish, Russian, Czech, Spanish and English.
Furthermore, and unlike the vast majority of previous work, we also evaluate
lemmatizers in out-of-domain settings, which constitutes, after all, their most
common application use. The results of our study are rather surprising. It
turns out that providing lemmatizers with fine-grained morphological features
during training is not that beneficial, not even for agglutinative languages.
In fact, modern contextual word representations seem to implicitly encode
enough morphological information to obtain competitive contextual lemmatizers
without seeing any explicit morphological signal. Moreover, our experiments
suggest that the best lemmatizers out-of-domain are those using simple UPOS
tags or those trained without morphology and, finally, that current evaluation
practices for lemmatization are not adequate to clearly discriminate between
models.

<span><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language
understanding and generation. However, such impressive capability typically
comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in
both the deployment, inference, and training stages. With LLM being a
general-purpose task solver, we explore its compression in a task-agnostic
manner, which aims to preserve the multi-task solving and language generation
ability of the original LLM. One challenge to achieving this is the enormous
size of the training corpus of LLM, which makes both data transfer and model
post-training over-burdensome. Thus, we tackle the compression of LLMs within
the bound of two constraints: being task-agnostic and minimizing the reliance
on the original training dataset. Our method, named LLM-Pruner, adopts
structural pruning that selectively removes non-critical coupled structures
based on gradient information, maximally preserving the majority of the LLM's
functionality. To this end, the performance of pruned models can be efficiently
recovered through tuning techniques, LoRA, in merely 3 hours, requiring only

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>This work proposes to measure the scope of a patent claim as the reciprocal
of the self-information contained in this claim. A probability of occurrence of
the claim is obtained from a language model and this probability is used to
compute the self-information. Grounded in information theory, this approach is
based on the assumption that an unlikely concept is more informative than a
usual concept, insofar as it is more surprising. In turn, the more surprising
the information required to defined the claim, the narrower its scope. Five
language models are considered, ranging from simplest models (each word or
character is assigned an identical probability) to intermediate models (using
average word or character frequencies), to a large language model (GPT2).
Interestingly, the scope resulting from the simplest language models is
proportional to the reciprocal of the number of words or characters involved in
the claim, a metric already used in previous works. Application is made to
multiple series of patent claims directed to distinct inventions, where each
series consists of claims devised to have a gradually decreasing scope. The
performance of the language models is assessed with respect to several ad hoc
tests. The more sophisticated the model, the better the results. I.e., the GPT2
probability model outperforms models based on word and character frequencies,
which themselves outdo the simplest models based on word or character counts.
Still, the character count appears to be a more reliable indicator than the
word count.

<span><p>Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (It-LLMs) have been exhibiting
outstanding abilities to reason around cognitive states, intentions, and
reactions of all people involved, letting humans guide and comprehend
day-to-day social interactions effectively. In fact, several multiple-choice
questions (MCQ) benchmarks have been proposed to construct solid assessments of
the models' abilities. However, earlier works are demonstrating the presence of
inherent "order bias" in It-LLMs, posing challenges to the appropriate
evaluation. In this paper, we investigate It-LLMs' resilience abilities towards
a series of probing tests using four MCQ benchmarks. Introducing adversarial
examples, we show a significant performance gap, mainly when varying the order
of the choices, which reveals a selection bias and brings into discussion
reasoning abilities. Following a correlation between first positions and model
choices due to positional bias, we hypothesized the presence of structural
heuristics in the decision-making process of the It-LLMs, strengthened by
including significant examples in few-shot scenarios. Finally, by using the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique, we elicit the model to reason and mitigate
the bias by obtaining more robust models.
