<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13699">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>This study applies Activity Theory and investigates the attitudes and
contradictions of 67 English as a foreign language (EFL) students from four
Hong Kong secondary schools towards machine-in-the-loop writing, where
artificial intelligence (AI) suggests ideas during composition. Students
answered an open-ended question about their feelings on writing with AI.
Results revealed mostly positive attitudes, with some negative or mixed
feelings. From a thematic analysis, contradictions or points of tension between
students and AI stemmed from AI inadequacies, students' balancing enthusiasm
with preference, and their striving for language autonomy. The research
highlights the benefits and challenges of implementing machine-in-the-loop
writing in EFL classrooms, suggesting educators align activity goals with
students' values, language abilities, and AI capabilities to enhance students'
activity systems.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13702">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Large language models (LLMs) perform better when they produce step-by-step,
"Chain-of-Thought" (CoT) reasoning before answering a question, but it is
unclear if the stated reasoning is a faithful explanation of the model's actual
reasoning (i.e., its process for answering the question). We investigate
hypotheses for how CoT reasoning may be unfaithful, by examining how the model
predictions change when we intervene on the CoT (e.g., by adding mistakes or
paraphrasing it). Models show large variation across tasks in how strongly they
condition on the CoT when predicting their answer, sometimes relying heavily on
the CoT and other times primarily ignoring it. CoT's performance boost does not
seem to come from CoT's added test-time compute alone or from information
encoded via the particular phrasing of the CoT. As models become larger and
more capable, they produce less faithful reasoning on most tasks we study.
Overall, our results suggest that CoT can be faithful if the circumstances such
as the model size and task are carefully chosen.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13714">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>It is well known that AI-based language technology -- large language models,
machine translation systems, multilingual dictionaries, and corpora -- is
currently limited to 2 to 3 percent of the world's most widely spoken and/or
financially and politically best supported languages. In response, recent
research efforts have sought to extend the reach of AI technology to
``underserved languages.'' In this paper, we show that many of these attempts
produce flawed solutions that adhere to a hard-wired representational
preference for certain languages, which we call techno-linguistic bias.
Techno-linguistic bias is distinct from the well-established phenomenon of
linguistic bias as it does not concern the languages represented but rather the
design of the technologies. As we show through the paper, techno-linguistic
bias can result in systems that can only express concepts that are part of the
language and culture of dominant powers, unable to correctly represent concepts
from other communities. We argue that at the root of this problem lies a
systematic tendency of technology developer communities to apply a simplistic
understanding of diversity which does not do justice to the more profound
differences that languages, and ultimately the communities that speak them,
embody. Drawing on the concept of epistemic injustice, we point to the broader
sociopolitical consequences of the bias we identify and show how it can lead
not only to a disregard for valuable aspects of diversity but also to an
under-representation of the needs and diverse worldviews of marginalized
language communities.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>This paper investigates the emotional reasoning abilities of the GPT family
of large language models via a component perspective. The paper first examines
how the model reasons about autobiographical memories. Second, it
systematically varies aspects of situations to impact emotion intensity and
coping tendencies. Even without the use of prompt engineering, it is shown that
GPT's predictions align significantly with human-provided appraisals and
emotional labels. However, GPT faces difficulties predicting emotion intensity
and coping responses. GPT-4 showed the highest performance in the initial study
but fell short in the second, despite providing superior results after minor
prompt engineering. This assessment brings up questions on how to effectively
employ the strong points and address the weak areas of these models,
particularly concerning response variability. These studies underscore the

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>With generative AI advances, the exciting potential for autonomous agents to
manage daily tasks via natural language commands has emerged. However, cur rent
agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments,
substantially limiting real-world scenario representation. In this paper, we
build an environment for agent command and control that is highly realistic and
reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on websites,
and we create an environment with fully functional websites from four common
domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software
development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools
(e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage
human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of
benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task
completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and are
designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We
design and implement several autonomous agents, integrating recent techniques
such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex
tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end
task success rate of 10.59%. These results highlight the need for further
development of robust agents, that current state-of-the-art LMs are far from
perfect performance in these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to

<span><p>Grammatical error correction aims to correct ungrammatical sentences
automatically. Recently, some work has demonstrated the excellent capabilities
of closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) in grammatical
error correction. However, the potential of open-source LLMs remains
unexplored. In this paper, we introduced GrammarGPT, an open-source LLM, to
preliminary explore its potential for native Chinese grammatical error
correction. The core recipe of GrammarGPT is to leverage the hybrid dataset of
ChatGPT-generated and human-annotated. For grammatical errors with clues, we
proposed a heuristic method to guide ChatGPT to generate ungrammatical
sentences by providing those clues. For grammatical errors without clues, we
collected ungrammatical sentences from publicly available websites and manually
corrected them. In addition, we employed an error-invariant augmentation method
to enhance the ability of the model to correct native Chinese grammatical
errors. We ultimately constructed about 1k parallel data and utilized these
data to fine-tune open-source LLMs (e.g., Phoenix, released by The Chinese
University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen) with instruction tuning. The experimental
results show that GrammarGPT outperforms the existing SOTA system
significantly. Although model parameters are 20x larger than the SOTA baseline,
the required amount of data for instruction tuning is 1200x smaller,
illustrating the potential of open-source LLMs on native CGEC. Our GrammarGPT
ranks $3^{rd}$ on NLPCC2023 SharedTask1, demonstrating our approach's

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs) have achieved great
success in modern NLP. An important advantage of PLMs is good
out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Recently, diffusion models have attracted
a lot of work to apply diffusion to PLMs. It remains under-explored how
diffusion influences PLMs on OOD data. The core of diffusion models is a
forward diffusion process which gradually applies Gaussian noise to inputs, and
a reverse denoising process which removes noise. The noised input
reconstruction is a fundamental ability of diffusion models. We directly
analyze OOD robustness by measuring the reconstruction loss, including testing
the abilities to reconstruct OOD data, and to detect OOD samples. Experiments
are conducted by analyzing different training parameters and data statistical
features on eight datasets. It shows that finetuning PLMs with diffusion
degrades the reconstruction ability on OOD data. The comparison also shows that
diffusion models can effectively detect OOD samples, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in most of the datasets with an absolute accuracy improvement up to
18%. These results indicate that diffusion reduces OOD robustness of PLMs.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14004">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Models for affective text generation have shown a remarkable progress, but
they commonly rely only on basic emotion theories or valance/arousal values as
conditions. This is appropriate when the goal is to create explicit emotion
statements ("The kid is happy."). Emotions are, however, commonly communicated
implicitly. For instance, the emotional interpretation of an event ("Their dog
died.") does often not require an explicit emotion statement. In psychology,
appraisal theories explain the link between a cognitive evaluation of an event
and the potentially developed emotion. They put the assessment of the situation
on the spot, for instance regarding the own control or the responsibility for
what happens. We hypothesize and subsequently show that including appraisal
variables as conditions in a generation framework comes with two advantages.
(1) The generation model is informed in greater detail about what makes a
specific emotion and what properties it has. This leads to text generation that
better fulfills the condition. (2) The variables of appraisal allow a user to
perform a more fine-grained control of the generated text, by stating
properties of a situation instead of only providing the emotion category. Our
Bart and T5-based experiments with 7 emotions (Anger, Disgust, Fear, Guilt,
Joy, Sadness, Shame), and 7 appraisals (Attention, Responsibility, Control,
Circumstance, Pleasantness, Effort, Certainty) show that (1) adding appraisals
during training improves the accurateness of the generated texts by 10 pp in
F1. Further, (2) the texts with appraisal variables are longer and contain more
details. This exemplifies the greater control for users.

<span><p>Visual question answering (VQA) has been intensively studied as a multimodal
task that requires effort in bridging vision and language to infer answers
correctly. Recent attempts have developed various attention-based modules for
solving VQA tasks. However, the performance of model inference is largely
bottlenecked by visual processing for semantics understanding. Most existing
detection methods rely on bounding boxes, remaining a serious challenge for VQA
models to understand the causal nexus of object semantics in images and
correctly infer contextual information. To this end, we propose a finer model
framework without bounding boxes in this work, termed Looking Out of Instance
Semantics (LOIS) to tackle this important issue. LOIS enables more fine-grained
feature descriptions to produce visual facts. Furthermore, to overcome the
label ambiguity caused by instance masks, two types of relation attention
modules: 1) intra-modality and 2) inter-modality, are devised to infer the
correct answers from the different multi-view features. Specifically, we
implement a mutual relation attention module to model sophisticated and deeper
visual semantic relations between instance objects and background information.
In addition, our proposed attention model can further analyze salient image
regions by focusing on important word-related questions. Experimental results
on four benchmark VQA datasets prove that our proposed method has favorable

<span><p>This demo paper presents UnScientify, an interactive system designed to
detect scientific uncertainty in scholarly full text. The system utilizes a
weakly supervised technique that employs a fine-grained annotation scheme to
identify verbally formulated uncertainty at the sentence level in scientific
texts. The pipeline for the system includes a combination of pattern matching,
complex sentence checking, and authorial reference checking. Our approach
automates labeling and annotation tasks for scientific uncertainty
identification, taking into account different types of scientific uncertainty,
that can serve various applications such as information retrieval, text mining,
and scholarly document processing. Additionally, UnScientify provides
interpretable results, aiding in the comprehension of identified instances of
scientific uncertainty in text.

<span><p>We take as a case study the spread of Germanic syntactic features into
Romance dialects of North-Eastern Italy, which occurred after the immigration
of German people in the Tyrol during the High Middle Ages.
</p>
<p>An interactive map is produced using tools of what is called Geographic Data
Science. A smooth two-dimensional surface $\mathcal{G}$ expresses locally which
fraction of territory uses a given German language feature: it is obtained by
interpolating a discrete function that says if at any surveyed locality that
feature is used or not.\newline
</p>
<p>This surface $\mathcal{G}$ is thought of as the value at the present time of
a function describing a diffusion-convection phenomenon in two dimensions (here
said \emph{tidal} mode), which is subjected in a very natural way to the same
equation, suitably contextualized, used in physics for a number of
phenomenological facts like the heat diffusion. It is shown that solutions of
this equation, evaluated at the present time, fit well with the data as
interpolated by $\mathcal{G}$, thus providing convincing pictures of
diffusion-convection of the linguistic features of the case study, albeit
simplifications and approximations.\newline
</p>
<p>Very importantly, it is shown that Schmidt's 'waves' can be counted among the
solutions of the diffusion equation: superimposing Schmidt 'waves' to a 'tidal
flooding' can reproduce complexities of real linguistic diffusion events.

persuasive technologies for automating and improving hotel hospitality
recommender systems. First, we delve into the capabilities of ChatGPT, which
can understand and generate human-like text, enabling more accurate and
context-aware recommendations. We discuss the integration of ChatGPT into
recommender systems, highlighting the ability to analyze user preferences,
extract valuable insights from online reviews, and generate personalized
recommendations based on guest profiles. Second, we investigate the role of
persuasive technology in influencing user behavior and enhancing the persuasive
impact of hotel recommendations. By incorporating persuasive techniques, such
as social proof, scarcity and personalization, recommender systems can
effectively influence user decision-making and encourage desired actions, such
as booking a specific hotel or upgrading their room. To investigate the
efficacy of ChatGPT and persuasive technologies, we present a pilot experi-ment
with a case study involving a hotel recommender system. We aim to study the
impact of integrating ChatGPT and persua-sive techniques on user engagement,
satisfaction, and conversion rates. The preliminary results demonstrate the
potential of these technologies in enhancing the overall guest experience and
business performance. Overall, this paper contributes to the field of hotel
hospitality by exploring the synergistic relationship between LLMs and

<span><p>When faced with a large number of product reviews, it is not clear that a
human can remember all of them and weight opinions representatively to write a
good reference summary. We propose an automatic metric to test the prevalence
of the opinions that a summary expresses, based on counting the number of
reviews that are consistent with each statement in the summary, while
discrediting trivial or redundant statements. To formulate this opinion
prevalence metric, we consider several existing methods to score the factual
consistency of a summary statement with respect to each individual source
review. On a corpus of Amazon product reviews, we gather multiple human
judgments of the opinion consistency, to determine which automatic metric best
expresses consistency in product reviews. Using the resulting opinion
prevalence metric, we show that a human authored summary has only slightly
better opinion prevalence than randomly selected extracts from the source
reviews, and previous extractive and abstractive unsupervised opinion
summarization methods perform worse than humans. We demonstrate room for
improvement with a greedy construction of extractive summaries with twice the
opinion prevalence achieved by humans. Finally, we show that preprocessing
source reviews by simplification can raise the opinion prevalence achieved by
existing abstractive opinion summarization systems to the level of human

quantify the probability of an LLM "making a choice", the associated
uncertainty, and the consistency of that choice. (2) We apply this method to
study what moral beliefs are encoded in different LLMs, especially in ambiguous
cases where the right choice is not obvious. We design a large-scale survey
comprising 680 high-ambiguity moral scenarios (e.g., "Should I tell a white

pedestrian on the road?"). Each scenario includes a description, two possible

We administer the survey to 28 open- and closed-source LLMs. We find that (a)
in unambiguous scenarios, most models "choose" actions that align with
commonsense. In ambiguous cases, most models express uncertainty. (b) Some
models are uncertain about choosing the commonsense action because their

systems that flexibly encode, integrate, and interpret this data at scale can
potentially enable impactful applications ranging from scientific discovery to
care delivery. To enable the development of these models, we first curate
MultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark. MultiMedBench encompasses
14 diverse tasks such as medical question answering, mammography and
dermatology image interpretation, radiology report generation and
summarization, and genomic variant calling. We then introduce Med-PaLM
Multimodal (Med-PaLM M), our proof of concept for a generalist biomedical AI
system. Med-PaLM M is a large multimodal generative model that flexibly encodes
and interprets biomedical data including clinical language, imaging, and
genomics with the same set of model weights. Med-PaLM M reaches performance
competitive with or exceeding the state of the art on all MultiMedBench tasks,
often surpassing specialist models by a wide margin. We also report examples of
zero-shot generalization to novel medical concepts and tasks, positive transfer
learning across tasks, and emergent zero-shot medical reasoning. To further
probe the capabilities and limitations of Med-PaLM M, we conduct a radiologist
evaluation of model-generated (and human) chest X-ray reports and observe
encouraging performance across model scales. In a side-by-side ranking on 246
retrospective chest X-rays, clinicians express a pairwise preference for
Med-PaLM M reports over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% of

suitable multimodal models to capture these interactions? To answer these
questions, we propose an information-theoretic approach to quantify the degree
of redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy relating input modalities with an output

understanding. Although current vision--language models (VLMs) equipped with
Video Transformers have enabled temporal modeling and yielded superior results,
they are at the cost of huge computational power and thus too expensive to
deploy in real-time application scenarios. An economical workaround only
samples a small portion of frames to represent the main content of that video

understanding models usually randomly sample a set of frames or clips,
regardless of internal correlations between their visual contents, nor their
relevance to the problem. We argue that such kinds of aimless sampling may omit
the key frames from which the correct answer can be deduced, and the situation
gets worse when the sampling sparsity increases, which always happens as the
video lengths increase. To mitigate this issue, we propose two frame sampling
strategies, namely the most domain frames (MDF) and most implied frames (MIF),
to maximally preserve those frames that are most likely vital to the given

bootstrap manner, while MIS actively searches key frames customized for each

challenge is that low-bit quantization methods often lead to performance
degradation. It is important to understand how quantization impacts the

performance, this work aims to investigate the impact of quantization on
\emph{emergent abilities}, which are important characteristics that distinguish
LLMs from small language models. Specially, we examine the abilities of

designed a diverse set of task instruction types to cater the specific
requirements of the domain and constructed unique datasets that are tailored to
the media domain. Based on these, we proposed MediaGPT, a domain-specific LLM
for the Chinese media domain, training by domain-specific data and experts SFT
data. By performing human experts evaluation and strong model evaluation on a
validation set, this paper demonstrated that MediaGPT outperforms mainstream
models on various Chinese media domain tasks and verifies the importance of
domain data and domain-defined prompt types for building an effective
domain-specific LLM.

<span><p>The emergence of generative pre-trained models has facilitated the synthesis
of high-quality text, but it has also posed challenges in identifying factual
errors in the generated text. In particular: (1) A wider range of tasks now
face an increasing risk of containing factual errors when handled by generative
models. (2) Generated texts tend to be lengthy and lack a clearly defined
granularity for individual facts. (3) There is a scarcity of explicit evidence
available during the process of fact checking. With the above challenges in
mind, in this paper, we propose FacTool, a task and domain agnostic framework
for detecting factual errors of texts generated by large language models (e.g.,
ChatGPT). Experiments on four different tasks (knowledge-based QA, code
generation, mathematical reasoning, and scientific literature review) show the
efficacy of the proposed method. We release the code of FacTool associated with
ChatGPT plugin interface at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/factool .

<span><p>Financial analysis is an important tool for evaluating company performance.
Practitioners work to answer financial questions to make profitable investment
decisions, and use advanced quantitative analyses to do so. As a result,
Financial Question Answering (QA) is a question answering task that requires
deep reasoning about numbers. Furthermore, it is unknown how well pre-trained
language models can reason in the financial domain. The current
state-of-the-art requires a retriever to collect relevant facts about the
financial question from the text and a generator to produce a valid financial
program and a final answer. However, recently large language models like GPT-3
have achieved state-of-the-art performance on wide variety of tasks with just a
few shot examples. We run several experiments with GPT-3 and find that a
separate retrieval model and logic engine continue to be essential components
to achieving SOTA performance in this task, particularly due to the precise
nature of financial questions and the complex information stored in financial
documents. With this understanding, our refined prompt-engineering approach on
GPT-3 achieves near SOTA accuracy without any fine-tuning.
