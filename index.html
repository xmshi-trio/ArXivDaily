<span><p>Pre-trained transformer language models (LMs) have in recent years become the
dominant paradigm in applied NLP. These models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance on tasks such as information extraction, question answering,
sentiment analysis, document classification and many others. In the biomedical
domain, significant progress has been made in adapting this paradigm to NLP
tasks that require the integration of domain-specific knowledge as well as
statistical modelling of language. In particular, research in this area has
focused on the question of how best to construct LMs that take into account not
only the patterns of token distribution in medical text, but also the wealth of
structured information contained in terminology resources such as the UMLS.
This work contributes a data-centric paradigm for enriching the language
representations of biomedical transformer-encoder LMs by extracting text
sequences from the UMLS. This allows for graph-based learning objectives to be
combined with masked-language pre-training. Preliminary results from
experiments in the extension of pre-trained LMs as well as training from
scratch show that this framework improves downstream performance on multiple
biomedical and clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Language models (LMs) like BERT and GPT have revolutionized natural language
processing (NLP). However, privacy-sensitive domains, particularly the medical
field, face challenges to train LMs due to limited data access and privacy
constraints imposed by regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized solution that enables
collaborative learning while ensuring the preservation of data privacy. In this
study, we systematically evaluate FL in medicine across $2$ biomedical NLP
tasks using $6$ LMs encompassing $8$ corpora. Our results showed that: 1) FL
models consistently outperform LMs trained on individual client's data and
sometimes match the model trained with polled data; 2) With the fixed number of
total data, LMs trained using FL with more clients exhibit inferior
performance, but pre-trained transformer-based models exhibited greater
resilience. 3) LMs trained using FL perform nearly on par with the model
trained with pooled data when clients' data are IID distributed while
exhibiting visible gaps with non-IID data. Our code is available at:

<span><p>Open-domain question answering (QA) tasks usually require the retrieval of
relevant information from a large corpus to generate accurate answers. We
propose a novel approach called Generator-Retriever-Generator (GRG) that
combines document retrieval techniques with a large language model (LLM), by
first prompting the model to generate contextual documents based on a given
question. In parallel, a dual-encoder network retrieves documents that are
relevant to the question from an external corpus. The generated and retrieved
documents are then passed to the second LLM, which generates the final answer.
By combining document retrieval and LLM generation, our approach addresses the
challenges of open-domain QA, such as generating informative and contextually
relevant answers. GRG outperforms the state-of-the-art generate-then-read and
retrieve-then-read pipelines (GENREAD and RFiD) improving their performance at
least by +5.2, +4.2, and +1.6 on TriviaQA, NQ, and WebQ datasets, respectively.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recent vision-language models outperform vision-only models on many image
classification tasks. However, because of the absence of paired text/image
descriptions, it remains difficult to fine-tune these models for fine-grained
image classification. In this work, we propose a method, GIST, for generating
image-specific fine-grained text descriptions from image-only datasets, and
show that these text descriptions can be used to improve classification. Key
parts of our method include 1. prompting a pretrained large language model with
domain-specific prompts to generate diverse fine-grained text descriptions for
each class and 2. using a pretrained vision-language model to match each image
to label-preserving text descriptions that capture relevant visual features in
the image. We demonstrate the utility of GIST by fine-tuning vision-language
models on the image-and-generated-text pairs to learn an aligned
vision-language representation space for improved classification. We evaluate
our learned representation space in full-shot and few-shot scenarios across
four diverse fine-grained classification datasets, each from a different
domain. Our method achieves an average improvement of $4.1\%$ in accuracy over
CLIP linear probes and an average of $1.1\%$ improvement in accuracy over the
previous state-of-the-art image-text classification method on the full-shot
datasets. Our method achieves similar improvements across few-shot regimes.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11316">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Pre-trained language models (PLMs) serve as backbones for various real-world
systems. For high-stake applications, it's equally essential to have reasonable
confidence estimations in predictions. While the vanilla confidence scores of
PLMs can already be effectively utilized, PLMs consistently become
overconfident in their wrong predictions, which is not desirable in practice.
Previous work shows that introducing an extra calibration task can mitigate
this issue. The basic idea involves acquiring additional data to train models
in predicting the confidence of their initial predictions. However, it only
demonstrates the feasibility of this kind of method, assuming that there are
abundant extra available samples for the introduced calibration task. In this
work, we consider the practical scenario that we need to effectively utilize
training samples to make PLMs both task-solvers and self-calibrators. Three
challenges are presented, including limited training samples, data imbalance,
and distribution shifts. We first conduct pilot experiments to quantify various
decisive factors in the calibration task. Based on the empirical analysis
results, we propose a training algorithm LM-TOAST to tackle the challenges.
Experimental results show that LM-TOAST can effectively utilize the training
data to make PLMs have reasonable confidence estimations while maintaining the
original task performance. Further, we consider three downstream applications,
namely selective classification, adversarial defense, and model cascading, to
show the practical usefulness of LM-TOAST. The code will be made public at

<span><p>Participant recruitment based on unstructured medical texts such as clinical
notes and radiology reports has been a challenging yet important task for the
cohort establishment in clinical research. Recently, Large Language Models
(LLMs) such as ChatGPT have achieved tremendous success in various downstream
tasks thanks to their promising performance in language understanding,
inference, and generation. It is then natural to test their feasibility in
solving the cohort recruitment task, which involves the classification of a
given paragraph of medical text into disease label(s). However, when applied to
knowledge-intensive problem settings such as medical text classification, where
the LLMs are expected to understand the decision made by human experts and
accurately identify the implied disease labels, the LLMs show a mediocre
performance. A possible explanation is that, by only using the medical text,
the LLMs neglect to use the rich context of additional information that
languages afford. To this end, we propose to use a knowledge graph as auxiliary
information to guide the LLMs in making predictions. Moreover, to further boost
the LLMs adapt to the problem setting, we apply a chain-of-thought (CoT) sample
selection strategy enhanced by reinforcement learning, which selects a set of
CoT samples given each individual medical report. Experimental results and
various ablation studies show that our few-shot learning method achieves
satisfactory performance compared with fine-tuning strategies and gains superb
advantages when the available data is limited. The code and sample dataset of

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>The remarkable capabilities of large-scale language models, such as ChatGPT,
in text generation have incited awe and spurred researchers to devise detectors
to mitigate potential risks, including misinformation, phishing, and academic
dishonesty. Despite this, most previous studies, including HC3, have been
predominantly geared towards creating detectors that differentiate between
purely ChatGPT-generated texts and human-authored texts. This approach,
however, fails to work on discerning texts generated through human-machine
collaboration, such as ChatGPT-polished texts. Addressing this gap, we
introduce a novel dataset termed HPPT (ChatGPT-polished academic abstracts),
facilitating the construction of more robust detectors. It diverges from extant
corpora by comprising pairs of human-written and ChatGPT-polished abstracts
instead of purely ChatGPT-generated texts. Additionally, we propose the "Polish
Ratio" method, an innovative measure of ChatGPT's involvement in text
generation based on editing distance. It provides a mechanism to measure the
degree of human originality in the resulting text. Our experimental results
show our proposed model has better robustness on the HPPT dataset and two
existing datasets (HC3 and CDB). Furthermore, the "Polish Ratio" we proposed
offers a more comprehensive explanation by quantifying the degree of ChatGPT
involvement, which indicates that a Polish Ratio value greater than 0.2
signifies ChatGPT involvement and a value exceeding 0.6 implies that ChatGPT
generates most of the text.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>MeetEval is an open-source toolkit to evaluate all kinds of meeting
transcription systems. It provides a unified interface for the computation of
commonly used Word Error Rates (WERs), specifically cpWER, ORC WER and MIMO WER
along other WER definitions. We extend the cpWER computation by a temporal
constraint to ensure that only words are identified as correct when the
temporal alignment is plausible. This leads to a better quality of the matching
of the hypothesis string to the reference string that more closely resembles
the actual transcription quality, and a system is penalized if it provides poor
time annotations. Since word-level timing information is often not available,
we present a way to approximate exact word-level timings from segment-level
timings (e.g., a sentence) and show that the approximation leads to a similar
WER as a matching with exact word-level annotations. At the same time, the time
constraint leads to a speedup of the matching algorithm, which outweighs the
additional overhead caused by processing the time stamps.

<span><p>Traditional topic identification solutions from audio rely on an automatic

low-resource situations, the ASR system, even if available, produces

spontaneous speech containing hesitations can further degrade the performance
of the ASR model. In this paper, we investigate alternatives to the standard
text-only solutions by comparing audio-only and hybrid techniques of jointly

<span><p>Visual grounding (VG) aims to establish fine-grained alignment between vision

constructed using simple description texts, which do not require sufficient
reasoning over the images and texts. This has been demonstrated in a recent

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel benchmark of \underline{S}cene

dataset for humour generation and understanding. Humour is an abstract,
subjective, and context-dependent cognitive construct involving several
cognitive factors, making it a challenging task to generate and interpret.
Hence, humour generation and understanding can serve as a new task for
evaluating the ability of deep-learning methods to process abstract and
subjective information. Due to the scarcity of data, humour-related generation
tasks such as captioning remain under-explored. To address this gap,
OxfordTVG-HIC offers approximately 2.9M image-text pairs with humour scores to
train a generalizable humour captioning model. Contrary to existing captioning
datasets, OxfordTVG-HIC features a wide range of emotional and semantic
diversity resulting in out-of-context examples that are particularly conducive
to generating humour. Moreover, OxfordTVG-HIC is curated devoid of offensive
content. We also show how OxfordTVG-HIC can be leveraged for evaluating the
humour of a generated text. Through explainability analysis of the trained
models, we identify the visual and linguistic cues influential for evoking
humour prediction (and generation). We observe qualitatively that these cues
are aligned with the benign violation theory of humour in cognitive psychology.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11729">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved human-level fluency in text
generation, making it difficult to distinguish between human-written and
LLM-generated texts. This poses a growing risk of misuse of LLMs and demands
the development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. However, existing
detectors degrade detection accuracy by simply paraphrasing LLM-generated
texts. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these detectors in real-life
situations, such as when students use LLMs for writing homework assignments
(e.g., essays) and quickly learn how to evade these detectors, has not been
explored. In this paper, we propose OUTFOX, a novel framework that improves the
robustness of LLM-generated-text detectors by allowing both the detector and
the attacker to consider each other's output and apply this to the domain of
student essays. In our framework, the attacker uses the detector's prediction
labels as examples for in-context learning and adversarially generates essays
that are harder to detect. While the detector uses the adversarially generated
essays as examples for in-context learning to learn to detect essays from a
strong attacker. Our experiments show that our proposed detector learned
in-context from the attacker improves the detection performance on the attacked
dataset by up to +41.3 point F1-score. While our proposed attacker can
drastically degrade the performance of the detector by up to -57.0 point
F1-score compared to the paraphrasing method.

<span><p>This research studies the impact of online news on social and economic
consumer perceptions through semantic network analysis. Using over 1.8 million
online articles on Italian media covering four years, we calculate the semantic

the articles could anticipate consumers' judgments about the economic situation

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00841">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Multi-hop machine reading comprehension is a challenging task in natural
language processing as it requires more reasoning ability across multiple
documents. Spectral models based on graph convolutional networks have shown
good inferring abilities and lead to competitive results. However, the analysis
and reasoning of some are inconsistent with those of humans. Inspired by the
concept of grandmother cells in cognitive neuroscience, we propose a
heterogeneous graph attention network model named ClueReader to imitate the
grandmother cell concept. The model is designed to assemble the semantic
features in multi-level representations and automatically concentrate or
alleviate information for reasoning through the attention mechanism. The name
ClueReader is a metaphor for the pattern of the model: it regards the subjects
of queries as the starting points of clues, takes the reasoning entities as
bridge points, considers the latent candidate entities as grandmother cells,
and the clues end up in candidate entities. The proposed model enables the
visualization of the reasoning graph, making it possible to analyze the
importance of edges connecting entities and the selectivity in the mention and
candidate nodes, which is easier to comprehend empirically. Evaluations on the
open-domain multi-hop reading dataset WikiHop and drug-drug interaction dataset
MedHop proved the validity of ClueReader and showed the feasibility of its
application of the model in the molecular biology domain.

<span><p>Methods for making high-quality recommendations often rely on learning latent
representations from interaction data. These methods, while performant, do not
provide ready mechanisms for users to control the recommendation they receive.
Our work tackles this problem by proposing LACE, a novel concept value
bottleneck model for controllable text recommendations. LACE represents each
user with a succinct set of human-readable concepts through retrieval given
user-interacted documents and learns personalized representations of the
concepts based on user documents. This concept based user profile is then
leveraged to make recommendations. The design of our model affords control over
the recommendations through a number of intuitive interactions with a
transparent user profile. We first establish the quality of recommendations
obtained from LACE in an offline evaluation on three recommendation tasks
spanning six datasets in warm-start, cold-start, and zero-shot setups. Next, we
validate the controllability of LACE under simulated user interactions.
Finally, we implement LACE in an interactive controllable recommender system
and conduct a user study to demonstrate that users are able to improve the
quality of recommendations they receive through interactions with an editable
user profile.

<span><p>This study proposes a multitask learning architecture for extractive
summarization with coherence boosting. The architecture contains an extractive
summarizer and coherent discriminator module. The coherent discriminator is
trained online on the sentence vectors of the augmented textual input, thus
improving its general ability of judging whether the input sentences are
coherent. Meanwhile, we maximize the coherent scores from the coherent
discriminator by updating the parameters of the summarizer. To make the
extractive sentences trainable in a differentiable manner, we introduce two
strategies, including pre-trained converting model (model-based) and converting
matrix (MAT-based) that merge sentence representations. Experiments show that
our proposed method significantly improves the proportion of consecutive
sentences in the extracted summaries based on their positions in the original
article (i.e., automatic sentence-level coherence metric), while the goodness
in terms of other automatic metrics (i.e., Rouge scores and BertScores) are
preserved. Human evaluation also evidences the improvement of coherence and

<span><p>Narrative-driven recommendation (NDR) presents an information access problem
where users solicit recommendations with verbose descriptions of their
preferences and context, for example, travelers soliciting recommendations for
points of interest while describing their likes/dislikes and travel
circumstances. These requests are increasingly important with the rise of
natural language-based conversational interfaces for search and recommendation
systems. However, NDR lacks abundant training data for models, and current
platforms commonly do not support these requests. Fortunately, classical
user-item interaction datasets contain rich textual data, e.g., reviews, which
often describe user preferences and context - this may be used to bootstrap
training for NDR models. In this work, we explore using large language models
(LLMs) for data augmentation to train NDR models. We use LLMs for authoring
synthetic narrative queries from user-item interactions with few-shot prompting
and train retrieval models for NDR on synthetic queries and user-item
interaction data. Our experiments demonstrate that this is an effective
strategy for training small-parameter retrieval models that outperform other

<span><p>Artificial intelligence researchers have made significant advances in legal

causes of judgments reversals by causal inference methods and inject the
obtained causal relationships into the neural network as a priori knowledge.
And then, our framework is validated on a challenging dataset as a legal

<span><p>While state-of-the-art NLP models have demonstrated excellent performance for

on their lack of robustness. This is especially manifested as significant

solutions that rely on counterfactually augmented datasets show promising
results, but they are inherently limited because of the lack of access to
explicit causal structure. In this paper, we present an alternative approach
that relies on non-counterfactual data augmentation. Our proposal instead
relies on using noisy, cost-efficient data augmentations that preserve
semantics associated with the target aspect. Our approach then relies on
modelling invariances between different versions of the data to improve

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>In the complex domain of large language models (LLMs), striking a balance
between computational efficiency and maintaining model quality is a formidable
challenge. Navigating the inherent limitations of uniform quantization,
particularly when dealing with outliers, and motivated by the launch of
NVIDIA's H100 hardware, this study delves into the viability of floating-point
(FP) quantization, particularly focusing on FP8 and FP4, as a potential
solution. Our comprehensive investigation reveals that for LLMs, FP8 activation
consistently outshines its integer (INT8) equivalent, with the performance edge
becoming more noticeable in models possessing parameters beyond one billion.
For weight quantization, our findings indicate that FP4 exhibits comparable, if
not superior, performance to INT4, simplifying deployment on FP-supported
hardware like H100. To mitigate the overhead from precision alignment caused by
the disparity between weights and activations, we propose two scaling
constraints for weight quantization that negligibly impact the performance
compared to the standard W4A8 model. We additionally enhance our quantization
methods by integrating the Low Rank Compensation (LoRC) strategy, yielding
improvements especially in smaller models. The results of our investigation
emphasize the immense potential of FP quantization for LLMs, paving the way for
high-efficiency deployment in resource-limited settings.

containing both SC and NER. Using a format converter, we unify input formats
and employ a generative model to generate SC-labels, NER-labels, and associated

format accuracy. Our results show SC accuracy increased by 1.13 points and NER
by 1.06 points in SCNM compared to standalone tasks, with CM raising format
