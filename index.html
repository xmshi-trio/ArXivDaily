<span><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have presented new
opportunities for integrating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) into
biological research and education. This study evaluated the capabilities of
leading LLMs, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, PaLM2, Claude2, and SenseNova, in
answering conceptual biology questions. The models were tested on a
108-question multiple-choice exam covering biology topics in molecular biology,
biological techniques, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology. Among the
models, GPT-4 achieved the highest average score of 90 and demonstrated the
greatest consistency across trials with different prompts. The results
indicated GPT-4's proficiency in logical reasoning and its potential to aid
biology research through capabilities like data analysis, hypothesis
generation, and knowledge integration. However, further development and
validation are still required before the promise of LLMs in accelerating
biological discovery can be realized.

<span><p>The ability to interpret spoken language is connected to natural language
processing. It involves teaching the AI how words relate to one another, how
they are meant to be used, and in what settings. The goal of natural language
processing (NLP) is to get a machine intelligence to process words the same way
a human brain does. This enables machine intelligence to interpret, arrange,
and comprehend textual data by processing the natural language. The technology
can comprehend what is communicated, whether it be through speech or writing
because AI pro-cesses language more quickly than humans can. In the present
study, five NLP algorithms, namely, Geneism, Sumy, Luhn, Latent Semantic
Analysis (LSA), and Kull-back-Liebler (KL) al-gorithm, are implemented for the
first time for the knowledge summarization purpose of the High Entropy Alloys
(HEAs). The performance prediction of these algorithms is made by using the
BLEU score and ROUGE score. The results showed that the Luhn algorithm has the
highest accuracy score for the knowledge summarization tasks compared to the

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have drawn extensive attention from
academia and the public, due to the advent of the ChatGPT. While LLMs show
their astonishing ability in text generation for various tasks, privacy
concerns limit their usage in real-life businesses. More specifically, either
the user's inputs (the user sends the query to the model-hosting server) or the
model (the user downloads the complete model) itself will be revealed during
the usage. Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a promising solution to this
kind of problem. It protects both the user's input and the knowledge of the
model by splitting the model into a bottom part and a top part, which is
maintained by the user and the model provider, respectively. However, in this
paper, we demonstrate that in LLMs, VFL fails to protect the user input since
it is simple and cheap to reconstruct the input from the intermediate
embeddings. Experiments show that even with a commercial GPU, the input
sentence can be reconstructed in only one second. We also discuss several
possible solutions to enhance the privacy of vertical federated LLMs.

<span><p>We introduce and study the problem of adversarial arithmetic, which provides
a simple yet challenging testbed for language model alignment. This problem is
comprised of arithmetic questions posed in natural language, with an arbitrary
adversarial string inserted before the question is complete. Even in the simple
setting of 1-digit addition problems, it is easy to find adversarial prompts
that make all tested models (including PaLM2, GPT4, Claude2) misbehave, and
even to steer models to a particular wrong answer. We additionally provide a
simple algorithm for finding successful attacks by querying those same models,
which we name "prompt inversion rejection sampling" (PIRS). We finally show
that models can be partially hardened against these attacks via reinforcement
learning and via agentic constitutional loops. However, we were not able to
make a language model fully robust against adversarial arithmetic attacks.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>To address the data scarcity issue in Conversational question answering
(ConvQA), a dialog inpainting method, which utilizes documents to generate
ConvQA datasets, has been proposed. However, the original dialog inpainting
model is trained solely on the dialog reconstruction task, resulting in the
generation of questions with low contextual relevance due to insufficient
learning of question-answer alignment. To overcome this limitation, we propose
a novel framework called Dialogizer, which has the capability to automatically
generate ConvQA datasets with high contextual relevance from textual sources.
The framework incorporates two training tasks: question-answer matching (QAM)
and topic-aware dialog generation (TDG). Moreover, re-ranking is conducted
during the inference phase based on the contextual relevance of the generated
questions. Using our framework, we produce four ConvQA datasets by utilizing
documents from multiple domains as the primary source. Through automatic
evaluation using diverse metrics, as well as human evaluation, we validate that
our proposed framework exhibits the ability to generate datasets of higher

<span><p>We demonstrate a situation in which Large Language Models, trained to be

strategically deceive their users about this behavior without being instructed
to do so. Concretely, we deploy GPT-4 as an agent in a realistic, simulated
environment, where it assumes the role of an autonomous stock trading agent.
Within this environment, the model obtains an insider tip about a lucrative
stock trade and acts upon it despite knowing that insider trading is
disapproved of by company management. When reporting to its manager, the model
consistently hides the genuine reasons behind its trading decision. We perform
a brief investigation of how this behavior varies under changes to the setting,
such as removing model access to a reasoning scratchpad, attempting to prevent
the misaligned behavior by changing system instructions, changing the amount of
pressure the model is under, varying the perceived risk of getting caught, and
making other simple changes to the environment. To our knowledge, this is the
first demonstration of Large Language Models trained to be helpful, harmless,

artificial neural network (ANN) was trained using the data which had been
preprocessed to construct an original dataset. To train this network, suitable
books for middle school students were provided by the MEB, Oxford and Cambridge

Next, the custom prompts and their responses undergo multi-metric scoring to

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07593">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>A promising approach for improving the performance of vision-language models
like CLIP for image classification is to extend the class descriptions (i.e.,
prompts) with related attributes, e.g., using brown sparrow instead of sparrow.
However, current zero-shot methods select a subset of attributes regardless of
commonalities between the target classes, potentially providing no useful
information that would have helped to distinguish between them. For instance,
they may use color instead of bill shape to distinguish between sparrows and
wrens, which are both brown. We propose Follow-up Differential Descriptions
(FuDD), a zero-shot approach that tailors the class descriptions to each
dataset and leads to additional attributes that better differentiate the target
classes. FuDD first identifies the ambiguous classes for each image, and then
uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate new class descriptions that
differentiate between them. The new class descriptions resolve the initial
ambiguity and help predict the correct label. In our experiments, FuDD
consistently outperforms generic description ensembles and naive LLM-generated
descriptions on 12 datasets. We show that differential descriptions are an
effective tool to resolve class ambiguities, which otherwise significantly
degrade the performance. We also show that high quality natural language class
descriptions produced by FuDD result in comparable performance to few-shot

<span><p>This review paper explores Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which

real-world human-computer interactions and hinting at a potential pathway to
artificial general intelligence. However, MLLMs still face challenges in
processing the semantic gap in multimodality, which may lead to erroneous
generation, posing potential risks to society. Choosing the appropriate
modality alignment method is crucial, as improper methods might require more
parameters with limited performance improvement. This paper aims to explore
modality alignment methods for LLMs and their existing capabilities.
Implementing modality alignment allows LLMs to address environmental issues and
enhance accessibility. The study surveys existing modal alignment methods in
MLLMs into four groups: (1) Multimodal Converters that change data into
something LLMs can understand; (2) Multimodal Perceivers to improve how LLMs
perceive different types of data; (3) Tools Assistance for changing data into
one common format, usually text; and (4) Data-Driven methods that teach LLMs to
understand specific types of data in a dataset. This field is still in a phase

Translating the data results in an English version of the model with similar

market reactions across topics. I find evidence for strong positive or negative
market reactions for some topics, like announcements of new Large Scale

effects for some other topics. Furthermore, in contrast to previous studies,
the multi-label structure of the model allows to analyze the effects of
co-occurring topics on stock market reactions. For many cases, the reaction to
a specific topic depends heavily on the co-occurrence with other topics. For
example, if allocated capital from a Seasoned Equity Offering (SEO) is used for

some form of understanding beyond the correlations among the words in text
including some understanding of mathematics as well. Here, we perform a
critical inquiry into this claim by evaluating the mathematical understanding
of the GPT-4 model. Considering that GPT-4's training set is a secret, it is
not straightforward to evaluate whether the model's correct answers are based
on a mathematical understanding or based on replication of proofs that the
model has seen before. We specifically craft mathematical questions which their
formal proofs are not readily available on the web, proofs that are more likely
not seen by the GPT-4. We see that GPT-4 is unable to solve those problems
despite their simplicity. It is hard to find scientific evidence suggesting
that GPT-4 has acquired an understanding of even basic mathematical concepts. A
straightforward way to find failure modes of GPT-4 in theorem proving is to
craft questions where their formal proofs are not available on the web. Our
finding suggests that GPT-4's ability is to reproduce, rephrase, and polish the
mathematical proofs that it has seen before, and not in grasping mathematical
concepts. We also see that GPT-4's ability to prove mathematical theorems is
continuously expanding over time despite the claim that it is a fixed model. We
suggest that the task of proving mathematical theorems in formal language is
comparable to the methods used in search engines such as Google while
predicting the next word in a sentence may be a misguided approach, a recipe
that often leads to excessive extrapolation and eventual failures. Prompting

on the updated target LLM, while the target LLM also improves itself through
safety fine-tuning. On adversarial prompt benchmarks, the violation rate of an
LLM with limited safety alignment reduces up to 84.7% after 4 rounds of MART,
achieving comparable performance to LLMs with extensive adversarial prompt
writing. Notably, model helpfulness on non-adversarial prompts remains stable
throughout iterations, indicating the target LLM maintains strong performance
on instruction following.

<span><p>The surprisingly likely criterion in the seminal work of Prelec (the Bayesian
Truth Serum) guarantees truthfulness in a game-theoretic multi-agent setting,
by rewarding rational agents to maximise the expected information gain with
their answers w.r.t. their probabilistic beliefs. We investigate the relevance
of a similar criterion for responses of LLMs. We hypothesize that if the
surprisingly likely criterion works in LLMs, under certain conditions, the
responses that maximize the reward under this criterion should be more accurate
than the responses that only maximize the posterior probability. Using
benchmarks including the TruthfulQA benchmark and using openly available LLMs:
GPT-2 and LLaMA-2, we show that the method indeed improves the accuracy
significantly (for example, upto 24 percentage points aggregate improvement on
TruthfulQA and upto 70 percentage points improvement on individual categories

<span><p>Large language models (LLMs) have opened up enormous opportunities while
simultaneously posing ethical dilemmas. One of the major concerns is their
ability to create text that closely mimics human writing, which can lead to
potential misuse, such as academic misconduct, disinformation, and fraud. To
address this problem, we present AuthentiGPT, an efficient classifier that
distinguishes between machine-generated and human-written texts. Under the
assumption that human-written text resides outside the distribution of
machine-generated text, AuthentiGPT leverages a black-box LLM to denoise input
text with artificially added noise, and then semantically compares the denoised
text with the original to determine if the content is machine-generated. With
only one trainable parameter, AuthentiGPT eliminates the need for a large
training dataset, watermarking the LLM's output, or computing the
log-likelihood. Importantly, the detection capability of AuthentiGPT can be
easily adapted to any generative language model. With a 0.918 AUROC score on a
domain-specific dataset, AuthentiGPT demonstrates its effectiveness over other
commercial algorithms, highlighting its potential for detecting
machine-generated text in academic settings.

<span><p>It is well-known that interlocutors who entrain to one another have more
successful conversations than those who do not. Previous research has shown
that interlocutors entrain on linguistic features in both written and spoken

shown preliminary evidence of entrainment on certain aspects of code-switching

extremely few and restricted to human-machine textual interactions. Our work
studies code-switched spontaneous speech between humans by answering the
following questions: 1) Do patterns of written and spoken entrainment in
monolingual settings generalize to code-switched settings? 2) Do patterns of
entrainment on code-switching in generated text generalize to spontaneous
code-switched speech? We find evidence of affirmative answers to both of these

<span><p>Integrating information from multiple modalities is arguably one of the
essential prerequisites for grounding artificial intelligence systems with an
understanding of the real world. Recent advances in video transformers that
jointly learn from vision, text, and sound over time have made some progress
toward this goal, but the degree to which these models integrate information
from modalities still remains unclear. In this work, we present a promising
approach for probing a pre-trained multimodal video transformer model by
leveraging neuroscientific evidence of multimodal information processing in the
brain. Using brain recordings of participants watching a popular TV show, we
analyze the effects of multi-modal connections and interactions in a
pre-trained multi-modal video transformer on the alignment with uni- and
multi-modal brain regions. We find evidence that vision enhances masked
prediction performance during language processing, providing support that
cross-modal representations in models can benefit individual modalities.
However, we don't find evidence of brain-relevant information captured by the
joint multi-modal transformer representations beyond that captured by all of
the individual modalities. We finally show that the brain alignment of the
pre-trained joint representation can be improved by fine-tuning using a task
that requires vision-language inferences. Overall, our results paint an
optimistic picture of the ability of multi-modal transformers to integrate
vision and language in partially brain-relevant ways but also show that
improving the brain alignment of these models may require new approaches.

learns to perform the task without weight updates. Despite ICL's prevalence and
utility, we understand little about whether models supervised in this manner
represent the underlying structure of their tasks, rather than superficial
heuristics that only generalize to identically distributed examples. In this
study, we investigate the robustness of LLMs supervised via ICL using the test
case of sensitivity to syntax, which is a prerequisite for robust language
understanding. Our experiments are based on two simple and well-controlled
syntactic transformations tasks, where correct out-of-distribution
generalization requires an accurate syntactic analysis of the input. We further
investigate whether out-of-distribution generalization can be improved via
chain-of-thought prompting, where the model is provided with a sequence of
intermediate computation steps that illustrate how the task ought to be
performed. In experiments with models from the GPT, PaLM, and Llama 2 families,
we find large variance across LMs on this fundamental linguistic phenomenon,
and that the variance is explained more by the composition of the pre-training
corpus and supervision methods than by model size. In particular, we find
evidence that models pre-trained on code generalize better, and benefit to a

language models with either full fine-tuning or parameter-efficient tuning.
However, the interaction between parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and
cross-lingual tasks in multilingual autoregressive models has yet to be
studied. Specifically, we lack an understanding of the role of linguistic
distributions in multilingual models in the effectiveness of token-based prompt
tuning. To address this question, we conduct experiments comparing prompt
tuning and fine-tuning on the decoder-based multilingual model, XGLM, with four
cross-lingual tasks (XNLI, PAWS-X, POS, NER). According to our study, prompt
tuning achieves on par or better performance over fine-tuning across all

flexibly verify the answer and makes it more trustworthy. Its evaluation not
only measures the correctness of the answer, but also the answer's
verifiability, i.e., how well the answer is supported by the corresponding
documents. In typical, verifiable generation adopts the retrieval-read
pipeline, which is divided into two stages: 1) retrieve relevant documents of
the question. 2) according to the documents, generate the corresponding answer.
Since the retrieved documents can supplement knowledge for the LLM to generate
the answer and serve as evidence, the retrieval stage is essential for the
correctness and verifiability of the answer. However, the widely used
retrievers become the bottleneck of the entire pipeline and limit the overall
performance. They often have fewer parameters than the large language model and
have not been proven to scale well to the size of LLMs. Since the LLM passively
receives the retrieval result, if the retriever does not correctly find the
supporting documents, the LLM can not generate the correct and verifiable
answer, which overshadows the LLM's remarkable abilities. In this paper, we
propose LLatrieval (Large Language Model Verified Retrieval), where the LLM
updates the retrieval result until it verifies that the retrieved documents can
support answering the question. Thus, the LLM can iteratively provide feedback
to retrieval and facilitate the retrieval result to sufficiently support
verifiable generation. Experimental results show that our method significantly
outperforms extensive baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results.

<span><p>Recently, instruction-following audio-language models have received broad
attention for audio interaction with humans. However, the absence of
pre-trained audio models capable of handling diverse audio types and tasks has
hindered progress in this field. Consequently, most existing works have only
been able to support a limited range of interaction capabilities. In this
paper, we develop the Qwen-Audio model and address this limitation by scaling
up audio-language pre-training to cover over 30 tasks and various audio types,
such as human speech, natural sounds, music, and songs, to facilitate universal
audio understanding abilities. However, directly co-training all tasks and
datasets can lead to interference issues, as the textual labels associated with
different datasets exhibit considerable variations due to differences in task
focus, language, granularity of annotation, and text structure. To overcome the
one-to-many interference, we carefully design a multi-task training framework
by conditioning on a sequence of hierarchical tags to the decoder for
encouraging knowledge sharing and avoiding interference through shared and
specified tags respectively. Remarkably, Qwen-Audio achieves impressive
performance across diverse benchmark tasks without requiring any task-specific
fine-tuning, surpassing its counterparts. Building upon the capabilities of
Qwen-Audio, we further develop Qwen-Audio-Chat, which allows for input from
various audios and text inputs, enabling multi-turn dialogues and supporting
various audio-central scenarios.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
their ability to generate synthetic query-document pairs by prompting with as
few as 8 demonstrations. This has enabled building better IR models, especially
for tasks with no training data readily available. Typically, such synthetic
query generation (QGen) approaches condition on an input context (e.g. a text
document) and generate a query relevant to that context, or condition the QGen
model additionally on the relevance label (e.g. relevant vs irrelevant) to
generate queries across relevance buckets. However, we find that such QGen
approaches are sub-optimal as they require the model to reason about the
desired label and the input from a handful of examples. In this work, we
propose to reduce this burden of LLMs by generating queries simultaneously for
different labels. We hypothesize that instead of asking the model to generate,
say, an irrelevant query given an input context, asking the model to generate
an irrelevant query relative to a relevant query is a much simpler task setup
for the model to reason about. Extensive experimentation across seven IR
datasets shows that synthetic queries generated in such a fashion translates to
a better downstream performance, suggesting that the generated queries are
indeed of higher quality.

<span><p>Logical reasoning has been an ongoing pursuit in the field of AI. Despite
significant advancements made by large language models (LLMs), they still
struggle with complex logical reasoning problems. To enhance reasoning
performance, one promising direction is scalable oversight, which requires LLMs
to identify their own errors and then improve by themselves. Various
self-verification methods have been proposed in pursuit of this goal.
Nevertheless, whether existing models understand their own errors well is still
under investigation. In this paper, we take a closer look at the
self-verification abilities of LLMs in the context of logical reasoning,
focusing on their ability to identify logical fallacies accurately. We
introduce a dataset, FALLACIES, containing 232 types of reasoning fallacies
categorized in a hierarchical taxonomy. By conducting exhaustive experiments on
FALLACIES, we obtain comprehensive and detailed analyses of a series of models
on their verification abilities. Our main findings suggest that existing LLMs

<span><p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
generative abilities, but can they judge the quality of their own generations?
A popular concept, referred to as self-refinement, postulates that LLMs can
detect and correct the errors in their generations when asked to do so.
However, recent empirical evidence points in the opposite direction, suggesting
that LLMs often struggle to accurately identify errors when reasoning is
involved. To address this, we propose a reasoning with refinement objective
called ART: Ask, Refine, and Trust, which asks necessary questions to decide
when an LLM should refine its output, and either affirm or withhold trust in
its refinement by ranking the refinement and the initial prediction. On two
multistep reasoning tasks of mathematical word problems (GSM8K) and question

self-refinement baselines, while using a much smaller model as the decision

Uncertainty-aware Teacher Learning that leverages the prediction uncertainty to

<span><p>In an ever-evolving world, the dynamic nature of knowledge presents
challenges for language models that are trained on static data, leading to
outdated encoded information. However, real-world scenarios require models not
only to acquire new knowledge but also to overwrite outdated information into
updated ones. To address this under-explored issue, we introduce the temporally
evolving question answering benchmark, EvolvingQA - a novel benchmark designed
for training and evaluating LMs on an evolving Wikipedia database, where the
construction of our benchmark is automated with our pipeline using large
language models. Our benchmark incorporates question-answering as a downstream
task to emulate real-world applications. Through EvolvingQA, we uncover that
existing continual learning baselines have difficulty in updating and
forgetting outdated knowledge. Our findings suggest that the models fail to
learn updated knowledge due to the small weight gradient. Furthermore, we
elucidate that the models struggle mostly on providing numerical or temporal
answers to questions asking for updated knowledge. Our work aims to model the
dynamic nature of real-world information, offering a robust measure for the
evolution-adaptability of language models.

<span><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can justify or criticize their predictions
through discussion with other models or humans, thereby enhancing their
intrinsic understanding of instances. While proactive discussions enhance
performance, this approach is currently limited to the inference phase. In this
context, we posit a hypothesis: learning interactive discussions during
training can improve understanding for the instances in the training step and
proficiency in logical/critical thinking ability and verbalized expression of
the model in the inference step. Our proposed SAIE training method involves
both supportive and adversarial discussions between the learner and partner
models. The learner model receives a remark from the partner through the
discussion, and the parameters of the learner model are then updated based on
this remark. That is, the teacher signal dynamically adjusts in response to the
evolving model output throughout the training step. By bolstering the capacity
for discussion and comprehension of instances, our experiments across datasets,
including GSM8K, CommonsenseQA, and MMLU, reveal that models fine-tuned with
our method consistently surpass those trained with standard fine-tuning
techniques. Moreover, our approach demonstrates superior performance in
multi-agent inference scenarios, boosting the models' reasoning abilities at

<span><p>Hateful memes have emerged as a significant concern on the Internet. These
memes, which are a combination of image and text, often convey messages vastly
different from their individual meanings. Thus, detecting hateful memes
requires the system to jointly understand the visual and textual modalities.
However, our investigation reveals that the embedding space of existing
CLIP-based systems lacks sensitivity to subtle differences in memes that are
vital for correct hatefulness classification. To address this issue, we propose
constructing a hatefulness-aware embedding space through retrieval-guided
contrastive training. Specifically, we add an auxiliary loss that utilizes hard
negative and pseudo-gold samples to train the embedding space. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the HatefulMemes dataset with an AUROC

Multimodal Models like Flamingo and LLaVA. Finally, we demonstrate a
retrieval-based hateful memes detection system, which is capable of making
hatefulness classification based on data unseen in training from a database.
This allows developers to update the hateful memes detection system by simply
adding new data without retraining, a desirable feature for real services in

<span><p>In this work, we propose FastCoT, a model-agnostic framework based on
parallel decoding without any further training of an auxiliary model or
modification to the LLM itself. FastCoT uses a size-varying context window
whose size changes with position to conduct parallel decoding and
auto-regressive decoding simultaneously, thus fully utilizing GPU computation
resources. In FastCoT, the parallel decoding part provides the LLM with a quick
glance of the future composed of approximate tokens, which could lead to faster
answers compared to regular autoregressive decoding used by causal
transformers. We also provide an implementation of parallel decoding within
LLM, which supports KV-cache generation and batch processing. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that FastCoT saves inference time by nearly 20%
with only a negligible performance drop compared to the regular approach.
Additionally, we show that the context window size exhibits considerable
robustness for different tasks.

<span><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, are designed to
provide useful and safe responses. However, adversarial prompts known as
'jailbreaks' can circumvent safeguards, leading LLMs to generate harmful
content. Exploring jailbreak prompts can help to better reveal the weaknesses
of LLMs and further steer us to secure them. Unfortunately, existing jailbreak
methods either suffer from intricate manual design or require optimization on
another white-box model, compromising generalization or jailbreak efficiency.
In this paper, we generalize jailbreak prompt attacks into two aspects: (1)
Prompt Rewriting and (2) Scenario Nesting. Based on this, we propose ReNeLLM,
an automatic framework that leverages LLMs themselves to generate effective
jailbreak prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReNeLLM significantly
improves the attack success rate while greatly reducing the time cost compared
to existing baselines. Our study also reveals the inadequacy of current defense
methods in safeguarding LLMs. Finally, we offer detailed analysis and
discussion from the perspective of prompt execution priority on the failure of
LLMs' defense. We hope that our research can catalyze both the academic
community and LLMs vendors towards the provision of safer and more regulated
Large Language Models.

the degree to which language-wise modularity naturally arises within models

degree to which a model's predictions are influenced by in-language or

<span><p>Most previous studies integrate cognitive language processing signals (e.g.,
eye-tracking or EEG data) into neural models of natural language processing

ignoring the gap between the two modalities (i.e., textual vs. cognitive) and
noise in cognitive features. In this paper, we propose a CogAlign approach to
these issues, which learns to align textual neural representations to cognitive
features. In CogAlign, we use a shared encoder equipped with a modality
discriminator to alternatively encode textual and cognitive inputs to capture
their differences and commonalities. Additionally, a text-aware attention
mechanism is proposed to detect task-related information and to avoid using
noise in cognitive features. Experimental results on three NLP tasks, namely
named entity recognition, sentiment analysis and relation extraction, show that
CogAlign achieves significant improvements with multiple cognitive features
over state-of-the-art models on public datasets. Moreover, our model is able to

disentangles input images into subjects, objects, and action sub-images and
composes CLIP's vision encoder and text encoder to perform evolving matching

ComCLIP can mitigate spurious correlations introduced by the pretrained CLIP
models and dynamically evaluate the importance of each component. Experiments

<span><p>Sequence models based on linear state spaces (SSMs) have recently emerged as
a promising choice of architecture for modeling long range dependencies across

In this work, we dispose of the discretization step, and propose a model based
on vanilla Diagonal Linear RNNs ($\mathrm{DLR}$). We empirically show that,
despite being conceptually much simpler, $\mathrm{DLR}$ is as performant as
previously-proposed SSMs on a variety of tasks and benchmarks including Long
Range Arena and raw speech classification. Moreover, we characterize the
expressivity of SSMs (including $\mathrm{DLR}$) and attention-based models via
a suite of $13$ synthetic sequence-to-sequence tasks involving interactions
over tens of thousands of tokens, ranging from simple operations, such as
shifting an input sequence, to detecting co-dependent visual features over long
spatial ranges in flattened images. We find that while SSMs report near-perfect
performance on tasks that can be modeled via $\textit{few}$ convolutional
kernels, they struggle on tasks requiring $\textit{many}$ such kernels and
especially when the desired sequence manipulation is
$\textit{context-dependent}$. Despite these limitations, $\mathrm{DLR}$ reaches
high performance on two higher-order reasoning tasks $\mathrm{ListOpsSubTrees}$

can differ in many ways: they may have different qualitative judgments about an

that these nuances can be captured by natural language explanations, and
propose a method to rescale ordinal annotations and explanations using LLMs.
Specifically, we feed annotators' Likert ratings and corresponding explanations
into an LLM and prompt it to produce a numeric score anchored in a scoring
rubric. These scores should reflect the annotators' underlying assessments of

include distinctions that may not have been known when the original error

LLM agents and study if, when, and how the teacher should intervene with
natural language explanations to improve the student's performance. Since
communication is expensive, we define a budget such that the teacher only
communicates explanations for a fraction of the data, after which the student
should perform well on its own. We decompose the teaching problem along four
axes: (1) if teacher's test time intervention improve student predictions, (2)
when it is worth explaining a data point, (3) how the teacher should
personalize explanations to better teach the student, and (4) if teacher
explanations also improve students on future unexplained data. We first show

<span><p>Transformer based language models exhibit intelligent behaviors such as
understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, acquiring knowledge,
reasoning, planning, reflecting and using tools. This paper explores how their
underlying mechanics give rise to intelligent behaviors. Towards that end, we
propose framing Transformer dynamics as movement through embedding space.
Examining Transformers through this perspective reveals key insights,
establishing a Theory of Transformers: 1) Intelligent behaviours map to paths
in Embedding Space which, the Transformer random-walks through during
inferencing. 2) LM training learns a probability distribution over all possible
paths. `Intelligence' is learnt by assigning higher probabilities to paths
representing intelligent behaviors. No learning can take place in-context;
context only narrows the subset of paths sampled during decoding. 5) The
Transformer is a self-mapping composition function, folding a context sequence
into a context-vector such that it's proximity to a token-vector reflects its
co-occurrence and conditioned probability. Thus, the physical arrangement of
vectors in Embedding Space determines path probabilities. 6) Context vectors
are composed by aggregating features of the sequence's tokens via a process we
call the encoding walk. Attention contributes a - potentially redundant -
association-bias to this process. 7) This process is comprised of two principal
operation types: filtering (data independent) and aggregation (data dependent).
This generalization unifies Transformers with other sequence models. Building
upon this foundation, we formalize a popular semantic interpretation of
embeddings into a ``concept-space theory'' and find some evidence of it's
validity.

<span><p>We present a series of long-context LLMs that support effective context
windows of up to 32,768 tokens. Our model series are built through continual
pretraining from Llama 2 with longer training sequences and on a dataset where
long texts are upsampled. We perform extensive evaluation on language modeling,
synthetic context probing tasks, and a wide range of research benchmarks. On
research benchmarks, our models achieve consistent improvements on most regular
tasks and significant improvements on long-context tasks over Llama 2. Notably,
with a cost-effective instruction tuning procedure that does not require
human-annotated long instruction data, the 70B variant can already surpass
gpt-3.5-turbo-16k's overall performance on a suite of long-context tasks.
Alongside these results, we provide an in-depth analysis on the individual
components of our method. We delve into Llama's position encodings and discuss
its limitation in modeling long dependencies. We also examine the impact of
various design choices in the pretraining process, including the data mix and
the training curriculum of sequence lengths -- our ablation experiments suggest
that having abundant long texts in the pretrain dataset is not the key to
achieving strong performance, and we empirically verify that long context
continual pretraining is more efficient and similarly effective compared to
pretraining from scratch with long sequences.

<span><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have ignited interest
in the temporal knowledge graph (tKG) domain, where conventional carefully
designed embedding-based and rule-based models dominate. The question remains
open of whether pre-trained LLMs can understand structured temporal relational
data and replace them as the foundation model for temporal relational

generative setting. However, challenges occur in the huge chasms between
complex temporal graph data structure and sequential natural expressions LLMs

costs of finetuning LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
retrieval augmented generation framework that performs generative forecasting
on tKGs named GenTKG, which combines a temporal logical rule-based retrieval

remarkable transferability with exceeding performance on unseen datasets

difficulty reasoning about and integrating all relevant information. We propose
a data-centric approach to enable LLMs to better handle financial tasks. Our
key insight is that rather than overloading the LLM with everything at once, it
is more effective to preprocess and pre-understand the data. We create a
financial LLM (FLLM) using multitask prompt-based finetuning to achieve data
pre-processing and pre-understanding. However, labeled data is scarce for each

<span><p>Simultaneous sequence generation is a pivotal task for real-time scenarios,
such as streaming speech recognition, simultaneous machine translation and
simultaneous speech translation, where the target sequence is generated while
receiving the source sequence. The crux of achieving high-quality generation
with low latency lies in identifying the optimal moments for generating,
accomplished by learning a mapping between the source and target sequences.
However, existing methods often rely on task-specific heuristics for different
sequence types, limiting the model's capacity to adaptively learn the
source-target mapping and hindering the exploration of multi-task learning for
various simultaneous tasks. In this paper, we propose a unified
segment-to-segment framework (Seg2Seg) for simultaneous sequence generation,
which learns the mapping in an adaptive and unified manner. During the process
of simultaneous generation, the model alternates between waiting for a source
segment and generating a target segment, making the segment serve as the
natural bridge between the source and target. To accomplish this, Seg2Seg
introduces a latent segment as the pivot between source to target and explores
all potential source-target mappings via the proposed expectation training,
thereby learning the optimal moments for generating. Experiments on multiple
simultaneous generation tasks demonstrate that Seg2Seg achieves
state-of-the-art performance and exhibits better generality across various

<span><p>Despite the recent progress in text summarization made by large language

previous small models (e.g., BART, T5), current LLMs make fewer silly mistakes
but more sophisticated ones, such as imposing cause and effect, adding false
details, overgeneralizing, etc. These hallucinations are challenging to detect
through traditional methods, which poses great challenges for improving the
factual consistency of text summarization. In this paper, we propose an
adversarially DEcoupling method to disentangle the Comprehension and
EmbellishmeNT abilities of LLMs (DECENT). Furthermore, we adopt a probing-based
efficient training to cover the shortage of sensitivity for true and false in
the training process of LLMs. In this way, LLMs are less confused about
embellishing and understanding; thus, they can execute the instructions more
accurately and have enhanced abilities to distinguish hallucinations.

Consider a human student who failed to solve a math problem, he will learn from
what mistake he has made and how to correct it. Mimicking this error-driven
learning process, LeMa fine-tunes LLMs on mistake-correction data pairs
generated by GPT-4. Specifically, we first collect inaccurate reasoning paths
from various LLMs and then employ GPT-4 as a "corrector" to (1) identify the
mistake step, (2) explain the reason for the mistake, and (3) correct the
mistake and generate the final answer. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of LeMa: across five backbone LLMs and two mathematical reasoning

<span><p>This paper proposes an efficient attempt to noisy speech emotion recognition
(NSER). Conventional NSER approaches have proven effective in mitigating the
impact of artificial noise sources, such as white Gaussian noise, but are
limited to non-stationary noises in real-world environments due to their
complexity and uncertainty. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new
method for NSER by adopting the automatic speech recognition (ASR) model as a
noise-robust feature extractor to eliminate non-vocal information in noisy
speech. We first obtain intermediate layer information from the ASR model as a
feature representation for emotional speech and then apply this representation
for the downstream NSER task. Our experimental results show that 1) the
proposed method achieves better NSER performance compared with the conventional
noise reduction method, 2) outperforms self-supervised learning approaches, and
3) even outperforms text-based approaches using ASR transcription or the ground
truth transcription of noisy speech.

<span><p>Large multimodal models (LMMs) suffer from multimodal hallucination, where
they provide incorrect responses misaligned with the given visual information.
Recent works have conjectured that one of the reasons behind multimodal
hallucination might be due to the vision encoder failing to ground on the image
properly. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel approach that leverages
self-feedback as visual cues. Building on this approach, we introduce Volcano,
a multimodal self-feedback guided revision model. Volcano generates natural
language feedback to its initial response based on the provided visual
information and utilizes this feedback to self-revise its initial response.
Volcano effectively reduces multimodal hallucination and achieves
state-of-the-art on MMHal-Bench, POPE, and GAVIE. It also improves on general
multimodal abilities and outperforms previous models on MM-Vet and MMBench.
Through a qualitative analysis, we show that Volcano's feedback is properly
grounded on the image than the initial response. This indicates that Volcano
can provide itself with richer visual information, helping alleviate multimodal
hallucination. We publicly release Volcano models of 7B and 13B sizes along
with the data and code at https://github.com/kaistAI/Volcano.

<summary class="article-expander__title">Investigating Multi-Pivot Ensembling with Massively Multilingual Machine Translation Models. (arXiv:2311.07439v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</summary>

<span><p>Massively multilingual machine translation models allow for the translation
of a large number of languages with a single model, but have limited
performance on low- and very-low-resource translation directions. Pivoting via
high-resource languages remains a strong strategy for low-resource directions,
and in this paper we revisit ways of pivoting through multiple languages.
Previous work has used a simple averaging of probability distributions from
multiple paths, but we find that this performs worse than using a single pivot,
and exacerbates the hallucination problem because the same hallucinations can
be probable across different paths. As an alternative, we propose MaxEns, a
combination strategy that is biased towards the most confident predictions,
hypothesising that confident predictions are less prone to be hallucinations.
We evaluate different strategies on the FLORES benchmark for 20 low-resource
language directions, demonstrating that MaxEns improves translation quality for
low-resource languages while reducing hallucination in translations, compared
to both direct translation and an averaging approach. On average, multi-pivot
strategies still lag behind using English as a single pivot language, raising
the question of how to identify the best pivoting strategy for a given
translation direction.
