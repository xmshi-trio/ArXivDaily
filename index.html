<summary class="article-expander__title">When Parameter-efficient Tuning Meets General-purpose Vision-language Models. (arXiv:2312.12458v1 [cs.CL])</summary>
<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12458">

<span><p>Instruction tuning has shown promising potential for developing
general-purpose AI capabilities by using large-scale pre-trained models and
boosts growing research to integrate multimodal information for creative
applications. However, existing works still face two main limitations: the high
training costs and heavy computing resource dependence of full model
fine-tuning, and the lack of semantic information in instructions, which
hinders multimodal alignment. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes
a novel approach to utilize Parameter-Efficient Tuning for generAl-purpose
vision-Language models, namely PETAL. PETAL revolutionizes the training process
by requiring only 0.5% of the total parameters, achieved through a unique mode
approximation technique, which significantly reduces the training costs and
reliance on heavy computing resources. Furthermore, PETAL enhances the semantic
depth of instructions in two innovative ways: 1) by introducing adaptive
instruction mixture-of-experts(MOEs), and 2) by fortifying the score-based
linkage between parameter-efficient tuning and mutual information. Our
extensive experiments across five multimodal downstream benchmarks reveal that
PETAL not only outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in most scenarios
but also surpasses full fine-tuning models in effectiveness. Additionally, our
approach demonstrates remarkable advantages in few-shot settings, backed by
comprehensive visualization analyses. Our source code is available at:

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>This paper proposes MotionScript, a motion-to-text conversion algorithm and
natural language representation for human body motions. MotionScript aims to
describe movements in greater detail and with more accuracy than previous
natural language approaches. Many motion datasets describe relatively objective
and simple actions with little variation on the way they are expressed (e.g.
sitting, walking, dribbling a ball). But for expressive actions that contain a
diversity of movements in the class (e.g. being sad, dancing), or for actions
outside the domain of standard motion capture datasets (e.g. stylistic walking,
sign-language), more specific and granular natural language descriptions are
needed. Our proposed MotionScript descriptions differ from existing natural
language representations in that it provides direct descriptions in natural
language instead of simple action labels or high-level human captions. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at translating 3D motions to
natural language descriptions without requiring training data. Our experiments
show that when MotionScript representations are used in a text-to-motion neural
task, body movements are more accurately reconstructed, and large language
models can be used to generate unseen complex motions.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>In-context learning (ICL) has revolutionized the capabilities of transformer
models in NLP. In our project, we extend the understanding of the mechanisms
underpinning ICL by exploring whether transformers can learn from sequential,
non-textual function class data distributions. We introduce a novel sliding
window sequential function class and employ toy-sized transformers with a GPT-2
architecture to conduct our experiments. Our analysis indicates that these
models can indeed leverage ICL when trained on non-textual sequential function
classes. Additionally, our experiments with randomized y-label sequences
highlights that transformers retain some ICL capabilities even when the label
associations are obfuscated. We provide evidence that transformers can reason
with and understand sequentiality encoded within function classes, as reflected
by the effective learning of our proposed tasks. Our results also show that the
performance deteriorated with increasing randomness in the labels, though not
to the extent one might expect, implying a potential robustness of learned
sequentiality against label noise. Future research may want to look into how
previous explanations of transformers, such as induction heads and task
vectors, relate to sequentiality in ICL in these toy examples. Our

<span><p>Time efficiency is paramount for the localisation industry, which demands
ever-faster turnaround times. However, translation speed is largely

contextual pruning. Our methodology strategically prunes the computational
architecture of traditional LLMs, like Phi-1.5, focusing on retaining core
functionalities while drastically reducing model sizes. We employ the technique
across diverse and complex datasets, including US law, Medical Q&amp;A, Skyrim
dialogue, English-Taiwanese translation, and Economics articles. The results
underscore the efficiency and effectiveness of contextual pruning, not merely
as a theoretical concept but as a practical tool in developing domain-specific,

<span><p>The vast majority of today's large language models are English-centric,
having been pretrained predominantly on English text. Yet, in order to meet
user expectations, models need to be able to respond appropriately in multiple
languages once deployed in downstream applications. Given limited exposure to

achieving decent performance in non-English settings. In this work, we
investigate just how much multilinguality is required during finetuning to
elicit strong cross-lingual generalisation across a range of tasks and target

represented by datasets that contain biases, toxicity, and harmfulness, finding
that while aligned LLMs can readily learn this unsafe content, they also tend
to forget it more significantly than other examples when subsequently finetuned

introduce the "ForgetFilter" algorithm, which filters unsafe data based on how
strong the model's forgetting signal is for that data. We demonstrate that the
ForgetFilter algorithm ensures safety in customized finetuning without

ForgetFilter outperforms alternative strategies like replay and moral

These findings emphasise the significance of fine-tuning efficient LLMs like

ALMANACS scores explainability methods on simulatability, i.e., how well the

span twelve safety-relevant topics such as ethical reasoning and advanced AI
behaviors; they have idiosyncratic premises to invoke model-specific behavior;
and they have a train-test distributional shift to encourage faithful

through iterative lattice generation. Since these NLMs work complementarily
with each other, by combining them one by one at each rescoring iteration,
language scores attached to given lattice arcs can be gradually refined.
Consequently, errors of the ASR hypotheses can be gradually reduced. We also
investigate the effectiveness of carrying over contextual information (previous
rescoring results) across a lattice sequence of a long speech such as a lecture
speech. In experiments using a lecture speech corpus, by combining the eight
NLMs and using context carry-over, we obtained a 24.4% relative word error rate

topically distinct from each other. In addition, the text of the announcements,
which is derived from images of historical newspapers via optical character

<span><p>Continued self-supervised (SSL) pre-training for adapting existing SSL models
to the target domain has shown to be extremely effective for low-resource
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). This paper proposes Stable Distillation, a
simple and novel approach for SSL-based continued pre-training that boosts ASR
performance in the target domain where both labeled and unlabeled data are
limited. Stable Distillation employs self-distillation as regularization for
continued pre-training, alleviating the over-fitting issue, a common problem
continued pre-training faces when the source and target domains differ.
Specifically, first, we perform vanilla continued pre-training on an initial
SSL pre-trained model on the target domain ASR dataset and call it the teacher.
Next, we take the same initial pre-trained model as a student to perform
continued pre-training while enforcing its hidden representations to be close
to that of the teacher (via MSE loss). This student is then used for downstream
ASR fine-tuning on the target dataset. In practice, Stable Distillation
outperforms all our baselines by 0.8 - 7 WER when evaluated in various
experimental settings.

exercises and medical reports of diverse branches of medicine. In particular,
this benchmark is composed of four key components: the Chinese Medical

Doctor In-Charge Qualification Examination, and real-world clinic cases
encompassing examinations, diagnoses, and treatments. MedBench replicates the
educational progression and clinical practice experiences of doctors in
Mainland China, thereby establishing itself as a credible benchmark for
assessing the mastery of knowledge and reasoning abilities in medical language

(1) Chinese medical LLMs underperform on this benchmark, highlighting the need
for significant advances in clinical knowledge and diagnostic precision. (2)
Several general-domain LLMs surprisingly possess considerable medical

open-source Chinese LLMs are evaluated with these tasks on our dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that these models are not competent to predict
CORECODE's plentiful reasoning content, and even ChatGPT could only achieve

<span><p>There exists a growing discourse around the domination of Big Tech on the
landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) research, yet our comprehension of
this phenomenon remains cursory. This paper aims to broaden and deepen our
understanding of Big Tech's reach and power within AI research. It highlights
the dominance not merely in terms of sheer publication volume but rather in the
propagation of new ideas or \textit{memes}. Current studies often oversimplify
the concept of influence to the share of affiliations in academic papers,
typically sourced from limited databases such as arXiv or specific academic
conferences.
</p>
<p>The main goal of this paper is to unravel the specific nuances of such
influence, determining which AI ideas are predominantly driven by Big Tech
entities. By employing network and memetic analysis on AI-oriented paper
abstracts and their citation network, we are able to grasp a deeper insight
into this phenomenon. By utilizing two databases: OpenAlex and S2ORC, we are
able to perform such analysis on a much bigger scale than previous attempts.
</p>
<p>Our findings suggest, that while Big Tech-affiliated papers are
disproportionately more cited in some areas, the most cited papers are those
affiliated with both Big Tech and Academia. Focusing on the most contagious
memes, their attribution to specific affiliation groups (Big Tech, Academia,
mixed affiliation) seems to be equally distributed between those three groups.
This suggests that the notion of Big Tech domination over AI research is
oversimplified in the discourse.
</p>
<p>Ultimately, this more nuanced understanding of Big Tech's and Academia's
influence could inform a more symbiotic alliance between these stakeholders

<span><p>Large language models (LLMs) have exerted a considerable impact on diverse
language-related tasks in recent years. Their demonstrated state-of-the-art
performance is achieved through methodologies such as zero-shot or few-shot
prompting. These models undergo training on extensive datasets that encompass
segments of the Internet and subsequently undergo fine-tuning tailored to
specific tasks. Notably, they exhibit proficiency in tasks such as translation,
summarization, question answering, and creative writing, even in the absence of
explicit training for those particular tasks. While they have shown substantial
improvement in the multilingual tasks their performance in the code switching,
especially for machine translation remains relatively uncharted. In this paper,
we present an extensive study on the code switching task specifically for the
machine translation task comparing multiple LLMs. Our results indicate that
despite the LLMs having promising results in the certain tasks, the models with
relatively lesser complexity outperform the multilingual large language models
in the machine translation task. We posit that the efficacy of multilingual
large language models in contextual code switching is constrained by their
training methodologies. In contrast, relatively smaller models, when trained
and fine-tuned on bespoke datasets, may yield superior results in comparison to
the majority of multilingual models.

<span><p>Warning: This paper contains examples of the language that some people may
find offensive.
</p>
<p>Detecting and reducing hateful, abusive, offensive comments is a critical and
challenging task on social media. Moreover, few studies aim to mitigate the
intensity of hate speech. While studies have shown that context-level semantics
are crucial for detecting hateful comments, most of this research focuses on
English due to the ample datasets available. In contrast, low-resource
languages, like Indian languages, remain under-researched because of limited
datasets. Contrary to hate speech detection, hate intensity reduction remains
unexplored in high-resource and low-resource languages. In this paper, we
propose a novel end-to-end model, HCDIR, for Hate Context Detection, and Hate
Intensity Reduction in social media posts. First, we fine-tuned several
pre-trained language models to detect hateful comments to ascertain the
best-performing hateful comments detection model. Then, we identified the
contextual hateful words. Identification of such hateful words is justified
through the state-of-the-art explainable learning model, i.e., Integrated
Gradient (IG). Lastly, the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) model has been
employed to capture domain-specific nuances to reduce hate intensity. We masked
the 50\% hateful words of the comments identified as hateful and predicted the
alternative words for these masked terms to generate convincing sentences. An
optimal replacement for the original hate comments from the feasible sentences
is preferred. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several recent
datasets using automatic metric-based evaluation (BERTScore) and thorough human
evaluation. To enhance the faithfulness in human evaluation, we arranged a
group of three human annotators with varied expertise.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13211">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>With the tremendous success of large transformer models in natural language
understanding, down-sizing them for cost-effective deployments has become
critical. Recent studies have explored the low-rank weight factorization
techniques which are efficient to train, and apply out-of-the-box to any
transformer architecture. Unfortunately, the low-rank assumption tends to be
over-restrictive and hinders the expressiveness of the compressed model. This
paper proposes, DSFormer, a simple alternative factorization scheme which
expresses a target weight matrix as the product of a small dense and a
semi-structured sparse matrix. The resulting approximation is more faithful to
the weight distribution in transformers and therefore achieves a stronger
efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Another concern with existing factorizers is
their dependence on a task-unaware initialization step which degrades the
accuracy of the resulting model. DSFormer addresses this issue through a novel
Straight-Through Factorizer (STF) algorithm that jointly learns all the weight
factorizations to directly maximize the final task accuracy. Extensive
experiments on multiple natural language understanding benchmarks demonstrate
that DSFormer obtains up to 40% better compression than the state-of-the-art
low-rank factorizers, leading semi-structured sparsity baselines and popular
knowledge distillation approaches. Our approach is also orthogonal to
mainstream compressors and offers up to 50% additional compression when added
to popular distilled, layer-shared and quantized transformers. We empirically
evaluate the benefits of STF over conventional optimization practices.

concept hierarchies by enabling them to learn novel concepts and solve unseen
robotics tasks with them. To enable a visual concept learner to solve robotics
tasks one-shot, we developed two distinct techniques. Firstly, we propose a
novel approach, Hi-Viscont(HIerarchical VISual CONcept learner for Task), which
augments information of a novel concept to its parent nodes within a concept
hierarchy. This information propagation allows all concepts in a hierarchy to
update as novel concepts are taught in a continual learning setting. Secondly,
we represent a visual task as a scene graph with language annotations, allowing
us to create novel permutations of a demonstrated task zero-shot in-situ. We
present two sets of results. Firstly, we compare Hi-Viscont with the baseline
model (FALCON) on visual question answering(VQA) in three domains. While being
comparable to the baseline model on leaf level concepts, Hi-Viscont achieves an
improvement of over 9% on non-leaf concepts on average. We compare our model's

<span><p>Adjusting the latency, power, and accuracy of natural language understanding
models is a desirable objective of an efficient architecture. This paper
proposes an efficient Transformer architecture that adjusts the inference
computational cost adaptively with a desired inference latency speedup. In
fine-tuning phase, the proposed method detects less important hidden sequence
elements (word-vectors) and eliminates them in each encoder layer using a
proposed Attention Context Contribution (ACC) metric. After the fine-tuning
phase, with the novel offline-tuning property, the inference latency of the
model can be adjusted in a wide range of inference speedup selections without
any further training. The proposed method is applied to the BERT-base and GPT-2
models for evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most of the word-vectors
in higher Transformer layers have less contribution to the subsequent layers;
hence, they can be eliminated to improve the inference latency. Experimental
results on extensive sentiment analysis, classification, text generation tasks
and regression benchmarks like GLUE showed that the method is effective in
various datasets with minimal impact on global context. The proposed method
mathematically and experimentally improves the inference latency of BERT-base
and GPT-2 by up to 4.8 and 3.72 times with less than 0.75% accuracy drop and
passable perplexity on average. The suggested approach posits that in Large

understanding events mentioned in multimedia content and how they are related
forms an important way of comprehending our world. Existing literature can
infer if events across textual and visual (video) domains are identical (via
grounding) and thus, on the same semantic level. However, grounding fails to
capture the intricate cross-event relations that exist due to the same events
being referred to on many semantic levels. For example, in Figure 1, the
abstract event of "war" manifests at a lower semantic level through subevents
"tanks firing" (in video) and airplane "shot" (in text), leading to a
hierarchical, multimodal relationship between the events.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose the task of extracting event hierarchies from
multimodal (video and text) data to capture how the same event manifests itself
in different modalities at different semantic levels. This reveals the
structure of events and is critical to understanding them. To support research
on this task, we introduce the Multimodal Hierarchical Events (MultiHiEve)

video-article pairs, which makes it rich in event hierarchies. We densely
annotate a part of the dataset to construct the test benchmark. We show the
limitations of state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal baselines on this task.
Further, we address these limitations via a new weakly supervised model,
leveraging only unannotated video-article pairs from MultiHiEve. We perform a

perform cold-start navigation with no prior information. However, deployed

addresses this disparity by training and evaluating VLN agents that maintain

<span><p>Error correction in automatic speech recognition (ASR) aims to correct those
incorrect words in sentences generated by ASR models. Since recent ASR models
usually have low word error rate (WER), to avoid affecting originally correct
tokens, error correction models should only modify incorrect words, and
therefore detecting incorrect words is important for error correction. Previous
works on error correction either implicitly detect error words through
target-source attention or CTC (connectionist temporal classification) loss, or
explicitly locate specific deletion/substitution/insertion errors. However,
implicit error detection does not provide clear signal about which tokens are
incorrect and explicit error detection suffers from low detection accuracy. In
this paper, we propose SoftCorrect with a soft error detection mechanism to
avoid the limitations of both explicit and implicit error detection.
Specifically, we first detect whether a token is correct or not through a
probability produced by a dedicatedly designed language model, and then design
a constrained CTC loss that only duplicates the detected incorrect tokens to
let the decoder focus on the correction of error tokens. Compared with implicit
error detection with CTC loss, SoftCorrect provides explicit signal about which
words are incorrect and thus does not need to duplicate every token but only
incorrect tokens; compared with explicit error detection, SoftCorrect does not
detect specific deletion/substitution/insertion errors but just leaves it to
CTC loss. Experiments on AISHELL-1 and Aidatatang datasets show that
SoftCorrect achieves 26.1% and 9.4% CER reduction respectively, outperforming
previous works by a large margin, while still enjoying fast speed of parallel
generation.

these two research threads, by integrating eye-movement control and sentence

computationally demanding, but such an integration is an important step toward
complete mathematical models of natural language comprehension in reading. We
combine the SWIFT model of eye-movement control (Seelig et al., 2020,
doi:10.1016/j.jmp.<a href="/abs/2019.10231">2019.10231</a>3) with key components of the Lewis and Vasishth

first time, due in part to recent advances in successful parameter
identification in dynamical models, which allows us to investigate profile
log-likelihoods for individual model parameters. We present a fully implemented
proof-of-concept model demonstrating how such an integrated model can be
achieved; our approach includes Bayesian model inference with Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling as a key computational tool. The integrated
Sentence-Processing and Eye-Movement Activation-Coupled Model (SEAM) can
successfully reproduce eye movement patterns that arise due to similarity-based
interference in reading. To our knowledge, this is the first-ever integration

Despite this vulnerability, robust contrastive vision-language pre-training
against such attacks has remained unaddressed. In this work, we propose ROCLIP,
the first effective method for robust pre-training multimodal vision-language
models against targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks. ROCLIP effectively
breaks the association between poisoned image-caption pairs by considering a
relatively large and varying pool of random captions, and matching every image
with the text that is most similar to it in the pool instead of its own
caption, every few epochs.It also leverages image and text augmentations to
further strengthen the defense and improve the performance of the model. Our
extensive experiments show that ROCLIP renders state-of-the-art targeted data
poisoning and backdoor attacks ineffective during pre-training CLIP models. In
particular, ROCLIP decreases the success rate for targeted data poisoning
attacks from 93.75% to 12.5% and that of backdoor attacks down to 0%, while
improving the model's linear probe performance by 10% and maintains a similar
zero shot performance compared to CLIP. By increasing the frequency of
matching, ROCLIP is able to defend strong attacks, which add up to 1% poisoned
examples to the data, and successfully maintain a low attack success rate of
12.5%, while trading off the performance on some tasks.

<span><p>Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models have exhibited exciting
progress in their capabilities, capturing the interest of practitioners and the
public alike. Yet, while the literature on the trustworthiness of GPT models
remains limited, practitioners have proposed employing capable GPT models for
sensitive applications such as healthcare and finance -- where mistakes can be
costly. To this end, this work proposes a comprehensive trustworthiness
evaluation for large language models with a focus on GPT-4 and GPT-3.5,
considering diverse perspectives -- including toxicity, stereotype bias,
adversarial robustness, out-of-distribution robustness, robustness on
adversarial demonstrations, privacy, machine ethics, and fairness. Based on our
evaluations, we discover previously unpublished vulnerabilities to
trustworthiness threats. For instance, we find that GPT models can be easily
misled to generate toxic and biased outputs and leak private information in
both training data and conversation history. We also find that although GPT-4
is usually more trustworthy than GPT-3.5 on standard benchmarks, GPT-4 is more
vulnerable given jailbreaking system or user prompts, potentially because GPT-4
follows (misleading) instructions more precisely. Our work illustrates a
comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation of GPT models and sheds light on the
trustworthiness gaps. Our benchmark is publicly available at
https://decodingtrust.github.io/; our dataset can be previewed at

<span><p>Modern language models capture a large body of factual knowledge. However,
some facts can be incorrectly induced or become obsolete over time, resulting
in factually incorrect generations. This has led to the development of various
editing methods that allow updating facts encoded by the model. Evaluation of
these methods has primarily focused on testing whether an individual fact has
been successfully injected, and if similar predictions for other subjects have
not changed. Here we argue that such evaluation is limited, since injecting one
fact (e.g. ``Jack Depp is the son of Johnny Depp'') introduces a ``ripple
effect'' in the form of additional facts that the model needs to update
(e.g.``Jack Depp is the sibling of Lily-Rose Depp''). To address this issue, we
propose a novel set of evaluation criteria that consider the implications of an
edit on related facts. Using these criteria, we then construct RippleEdits, a
diagnostic benchmark of 5K factual edits, capturing a variety of types of
ripple effects. We evaluate prominent editing methods on RippleEdits, showing
that current methods fail to introduce consistent changes in the model's
knowledge. In addition, we find that a simple in-context editing baseline
obtains the best scores on our benchmark, suggesting a promising research
direction for model editing.

<span><p>Model editing techniques modify a minor proportion of knowledge in Large
Language Models (LLMs) at a relatively low cost, which have demonstrated
notable success. Existing methods assume Transformer Layer (TL) hidden states
are values of key-value memories of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN). They
usually optimize the TL hidden states to memorize target knowledge and use it
to update the weights of the FFN in LLMs. However, the information flow of TL
hidden states comes from three parts: Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA), FFN,
and residual connections. Existing methods neglect the fact that the TL hidden
states contains information not specifically required for FFN. Consequently,
the performance of model editing decreases. To achieve more precise model
editing, we analyze hidden states of MHSA and FFN, finding that MHSA encodes
certain general knowledge extraction patterns. This implies that MHSA weights
do not require updating when new knowledge is introduced. Based on above
findings, we introduce PMET, which simultaneously optimizes Transformer
Component (TC, namely MHSA and FFN) hidden states, while only using the
optimized TC hidden states of FFN to precisely update FFN weights. Our
experiments demonstrate that PMET exhibits state-of-the-art performance on both
the COUNTERFACT and zsRE datasets. Our ablation experiments substantiate the
effectiveness of our enhancements, further reinforcing the finding that the
MHSA encodes certain general knowledge extraction patterns and indicating its
storage of a small amount of factual knowledge. Our code is available at

Reddit posts regarding medications for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), a critical

treatment information-seeking event dataset to analyze online discourse on an
event-based framework. This dataset contains Reddit posts on
information-seeking events related to recovery from OUD, where each post is
annotated based on the type of events. We also establish a strong performance

the hallucination of large language models (LLMs). However, existing research
lacks rigorous evaluation of the impact of retrieval-augmented generation on
different large language models, which make it challenging to identify the
potential bottlenecks in the capabilities of RAG for different LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically investigate the impact of Retrieval-Augmented
Generation on large language models. We analyze the performance of different
large language models in 4 fundamental abilities required for RAG, including
noise robustness, negative rejection, information integration, and
counterfactual robustness. To this end, we establish Retrieval-Augmented

LLMs exhibit a certain degree of noise robustness, they still struggle
significantly in terms of negative rejection, information integration, and

the quantitative element of the resultant summary. However, increasing the size
of the training set may not always be the ideal solution to maximize the
performance, and therefore, a need to revisit the quality of training samples
and the learning protocol of deep learning models is a must. In this paper, we
aim to discretize the vector space of the abstractive text summarization models

the models' encoder space. We show that deep models fail to capture the
diversity of the input space. Further, the distribution of data points on the
encoder space indicates that an unchecked increase in the training samples does
not add value; rather, a tear-down of data samples is highly needed to make the
models focus on variability and faithfulness. We employ clustering techniques
to learn the diversity of a model's sample space and how data points are mapped
from the embedding space to the encoder space and vice versa. Further, we
devise a metric to filter out redundant data points to make the model more
robust and less data hungry. We benchmark our proposed method using

the way crowdsourcing workflows address human error. To characterize
opportunities for LLM chaining, we survey 107 papers across the crowdsourcing
and chaining literature to construct a design space for chain development. The
design space connects an LLM designer's objectives to strategies they can use
to achieve those objectives, and tactics to implement each strategy. To explore
how techniques from crowdsourcing may apply to chaining, we adapt crowdsourcing
workflows to implement LLM chains across three case studies: creating a
taxonomy, shortening text, and writing a short story. From the design space and
our case studies, we identify which techniques transfer from crowdsourcing to
LLM chaining and raise implications for future research and development.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11985">

<span><p>Climate change presents significant challenges to the global community, and
it is imperative to raise widespread awareness of the climate crisis and
educate users about low-carbon living. Artificial intelligence, particularly
large language models (LLMs), have emerged as powerful tools in mitigating the
climate crisis, leveraging their extensive knowledge, broad user base, and
natural language interaction capabilities. However, despite the growing body of
research on climate change, there is a lack of comprehensive assessments of
climate crisis knowledge within LLMs. This paper aims to resolve this gap by
proposing an automatic evaluation framework. We employ a hybrid approach to
data acquisition that combines data synthesis and manual collection to compile
a diverse set of questions related to the climate crisis. These questions cover
various aspects of climate change, including its causes, impacts, mitigation
strategies, and adaptation measures. We then evaluate the model knowledge
through prompt engineering based on the collected questions and generated
answers. We propose a set of comprehensive metrics to evaluate the climate
crisis knowledge, incorporating indicators from 10 different perspectives.
Experimental results show that our method is effective in evaluating the
knowledge of LLMs regarding the climate crisis. We evaluate several
state-of-the-art LLMs and find that their knowledge falls short in terms of
timeliness.

<span><p>We introduce Efficient Title Reranker via Broadcasting Query Encoder, a novel
title reranking technique to achieve efficient title reranking 20x-40x faster
than vanilla passage reranker. However, one of the challenges with the training
of Efficient Title Reranker is the instability. Analyzing the issue, we found
some very difficult ground truths might act as noisy labels causing accuracy to
drop as well as some extreme values in model probability output causing nan. To
address these issues, we introduce the Sigmoid Trick, a novel technique that
reduces the gradient update of both cases resulting in better retrieval
efficacy. Experiments showed the effectiveness of ETR and sigmoid trick as we
achieved four state-of-the-art positions on the kilt knowledge benchmark.

<span><p>The surge of interest towards Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
e.g., GPT-4V(ision) from OpenAI, has marked a significant trend in both
academia and industry. They endow Large Language Models (LLMs) with powerful
capabilities in visual understanding, enabling them to tackle diverse
multi-modal tasks. Very recently, Google released Gemini, its newest and most
capable MLLM built from the ground up for multi-modality. In light of the
superior reasoning capabilities, can Gemini challenge GPT-4V's leading position
in multi-modal learning? In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration of
Gemini Pro's visual understanding proficiency, which comprehensively covers
four domains: fundamental perception, advanced cognition, challenging vision
tasks, and various expert capacities. We compare Gemini Pro with the
state-of-the-art GPT-4V to evaluate its upper limits, along with the latest
open-sourced MLLM, Sphinx, which reveals the gap between manual efforts and
black-box systems. The qualitative samples indicate that, while GPT-4V and
Gemini showcase different answering styles and preferences, they can exhibit
comparable visual reasoning capabilities, and Sphinx still trails behind them
concerning domain generalizability. Specifically, GPT-4V tends to elaborate
detailed explanations and intermediate steps, and Gemini prefers to output a
direct and concise answer. The quantitative evaluation on the popular MME
benchmark also demonstrates the potential of Gemini to be a strong challenger
to GPT-4V. Our early investigation of Gemini also observes some common issues
of MLLMs, indicating that there still remains a considerable distance towards
artificial general intelligence. Our project for tracking the progress of MLLM
is released at
