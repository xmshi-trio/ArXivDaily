<span><p>This paper presents an overview of the ImageArg shared task, the first
multimodal Argument Mining shared task co-located with the 10th Workshop on
Argument Mining at EMNLP 2023. The shared task comprises two classification
subtasks - (1) Subtask-A: Argument Stance Classification; (2) Subtask-B: Image
Persuasiveness Classification. The former determines the stance of a tweet
containing an image and a piece of text toward a controversial topic (e.g., gun
control and abortion). The latter determines whether the image makes the tweet
text more persuasive. The shared task received 31 submissions for Subtask-A and
21 submissions for Subtask-B from 9 different teams across 6 countries. The top
submission in Subtask-A achieved an F1-score of 0.8647 while the best
submission in Subtask-B achieved an F1-score of 0.5561.

<span><p>Direct neural machine translation (direct NMT) is a type of NMT system that
translates text between two non-English languages. Direct NMT systems often
face limitations due to the scarcity of parallel data between non-English
language pairs. Several approaches have been proposed to address this
limitation, such as multilingual NMT and pivot NMT (translation between two
languages via English). Task-level Mixture of expert models (Task-level MoE),
an inference-efficient variation of Transformer-based models, has shown
promising NMT performance for a large number of language pairs. In Task-level
MoE, different language groups can use different routing strategies to optimize
cross-lingual learning and inference speed. In this work, we examine Task-level
MoE's applicability in direct NMT and propose a series of high-performing
training and evaluation configurations, through which Task-level MoE-based
direct NMT systems outperform bilingual and pivot-based models for a large
number of low and high-resource direct pairs, and translation directions. Our
Task-level MoE with 16 experts outperforms bilingual NMT, Pivot NMT models for
7 language pairs, while pivot-based models still performed better in 9 pairs

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12274">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Textural Inversion, a prompt learning method, learns a singular embedding for
a new "word" to represent image style and appearance, allowing it to be
integrated into natural language sentences to generate novel synthesised
images. However, identifying and integrating multiple object-level concepts
within one scene poses significant challenges even when embeddings for
individual concepts are attainable. This is further confirmed by our empirical
tests. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for Multi-Concept
Prompt Learning (MCPL), where multiple new "words" are simultaneously learned
from a single sentence-image pair. To enhance the accuracy of word-concept
correlation, we propose three regularisation techniques: Attention Masking
(AttnMask) to concentrate learning on relevant areas; Prompts Contrastive Loss
(PromptCL) to separate the embeddings of different concepts; and Bind adjective
(Bind adj.) to associate new "words" with known words. We evaluate via image
generation, editing, and attention visualisation with diverse images. Extensive
quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our method can learn more
semantically disentangled concepts with enhanced word-concept correlation.
Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset and evaluation protocol tailored for
this new task of learning object-level concepts.

<span><p>In-context learning (ICL) is a new learning paradigm that has gained
popularity along with the development of large language models. In this work,
we adapt a recently proposed hardness metric, pointwise $\mathcal{V}$-usable
information (PVI), to an in-context version (in-context PVI). Compared to the
original PVI, in-context PVI is more efficient in that it requires only a few
exemplars and does not require fine-tuning. We conducted a comprehensive
empirical analysis to evaluate the reliability of in-context PVI. Our findings
indicate that in-context PVI estimates exhibit similar characteristics to the
original PVI. Specific to the in-context setting, we show that in-context PVI
estimates remain consistent across different exemplar selections and numbers of
shots. The variance of in-context PVI estimates across different exemplar
selections is insignificant, which suggests that in-context PVI are stable.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how in-context PVI can be employed to identify
challenging instances. Our work highlights the potential of in-context PVI and
provides new insights into the capabilities of ICL.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Despite the known limitations, most machine translation systems today still
operate on the sentence-level. One reason for this is, that most parallel
training data is only sentence-level aligned, without document-level meta
information available. In this work, we set out to build context-aware
translation systems utilizing document-level monolingual data instead. This can
be achieved by combining any existing sentence-level translation model with a
document-level language model. We improve existing approaches by leveraging
recent advancements in model combination. Additionally, we propose novel
weighting techniques that make the system combination more flexible and
significantly reduce computational overhead. In a comprehensive evaluation on
four diverse translation tasks, we show that our extensions improve
document-targeted scores substantially and are also computationally more
efficient. However, we also find that in most scenarios, back-translation gives
even better results, at the cost of having to re-train the translation system.
Finally, we explore language model fusion in the light of recent advancements
in large language models. Our findings suggest that there might be strong
potential in utilizing large language models via model combination.

<span><p>Large language models (LLMs) are a special class of pretrained language
models obtained by scaling model size, pretraining corpus and computation.
LLMs, because of their large size and pretraining on large volumes of text
data, exhibit special abilities which allow them to achieve remarkable
performances without any task-specific training in many of the natural language
processing tasks. The era of LLMs started with OpenAI GPT-3 model, and the
popularity of LLMs is increasing exponentially after the introduction of models
like ChatGPT and GPT4. We refer to GPT-3 and its successor OpenAI models,
including ChatGPT and GPT4, as GPT-3 family large language models (GLLMs). With
the ever-rising popularity of GLLMs, especially in the research community,
there is a strong need for a comprehensive survey which summarizes the recent
research progress in multiple dimensions and can guide the research community
with insightful future research directions. We start the survey paper with
foundation concepts like transformers, transfer learning, self-supervised
learning, pretrained language models and large language models. We then present
a brief overview of GLLMs and discuss the performances of GLLMs in various
downstream tasks, specific domains and multiple languages. We also discuss the
data labelling and data augmentation abilities of GLLMs, the robustness of
GLLMs, the effectiveness of GLLMs as evaluators, and finally, conclude with
multiple insightful future research directions. To summarize, this
comprehensive survey paper will serve as a good resource for both academic and
industry people to stay updated with the latest research related to GPT-3

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12342">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Chain-of-Thought(CoT) prompting and its variants explore equipping large
language models (LLMs) with high-level reasoning abilities by emulating
human-like linear cognition and logic. However, the human mind is complicated
and mixed with both linear and nonlinear thinking. In this work, we propose
\textbf{I}nferential \textbf{E}xclusion \textbf{P}rompting (IEP), a novel
prompting that combines the principles of elimination and inference in order to
guide LLMs to think non-linearly. IEP guides LLMs to plan and then utilize
Natural Language Inference (NLI) to deduce each possible solution's entailment
relation with context, commonsense, or facts, therefore yielding a broader
perspective by thinking back for inferring. This forward planning and backward
eliminating process allows IEP to better simulate the complex human thinking
processes compared to other CoT-based methods, which only reflect linear
cognitive processes. We conducted a series of empirical studies and have
corroborated that IEP consistently outperforms CoT across various tasks.
Additionally, we observe that integrating IEP and CoT further improves the
LLMs' performance on certain tasks, highlighting the necessity of equipping
LLMs with mixed logic processes. Moreover, to better evaluate comprehensive
features inherent in human logic, we introduce \textbf{M}ental-\textbf{A}bility
\textbf{R}easoning \textbf{B}enchmark (MARB). The benchmark comprises six novel
subtasks with a total of 9,115 questions, among which 1,685 are developed with
hand-crafted rationale references. We believe both \textsc{IEP} and

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12344">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>End-to-end Transformers have demonstrated an impressive success rate for
Embodied Instruction Following when the environment has been seen in training.
However, they tend to struggle when deployed in an unseen environment. This
lack of generalizability is due to the agent's insensitivity to subtle changes
in natural language instructions. To mitigate this issue, we propose explicitly
aligning the agent's hidden states with the instructions via contrastive
learning. Nevertheless, the semantic gap between high-level language
instructions and the agent's low-level action space remains an obstacle.
Therefore, we further introduce a novel concept of meta-actions to bridge the
gap. Meta-actions are ubiquitous action patterns that can be parsed from the
original action sequence. These patterns represent higher-level semantics that
are intuitively aligned closer to the instructions. When meta-actions are
applied as additional training signals, the agent generalizes better to unseen
environments. Compared to a strong multi-modal Transformer baseline, we achieve
a significant 4.5% absolute gain in success rate in unseen environments of
ALFRED Embodied Instruction Following. Additional analysis shows that the
contrastive objective and meta-actions are complementary in achieving the best
results, and the resulting agent better aligns its states with corresponding
instructions, making it more suitable for real-world embodied agents. The code

human-like content using LLMs necessitates vast computational resources and
extensive datasets, encapsulating critical intellectual property (IP). However,
the generated content is prone to malicious exploitation, including spamming

components: (i) a learning-based message encoding module to infuse binary
signatures into LLM-generated texts; (ii) a reparameterization module to
transform the dense distributions from the message encoding to the sparse
distribution of the watermarked textual tokens; (iii) a decoding module
dedicated for signature extraction; Furthermore, we introduce an optimized beam
search algorithm to guarantee the coherence and consistency of the generated

semantic integrity in watermarked content, while ensuring effective watermark
retrieval. Extensive evaluations on multiple unseen datasets highlight
REMARK-LLM proficiency and transferability in inserting 2 times more signature

<span><p>Modelling how concepts are related is a central topic in Lexical Semantics. A
common strategy is to rely on knowledge graphs (KGs) such as ConceptNet, and to

noisy. Another strategy is to distill relation embeddings from a fine-tuned

indirectly related and it does not readily allow us to incorporate structured

sequences, e.g., inputs with 8k tokens. Although sparse attention can be used
to improve computational efficiency, as suggested in existing work, it has
limited modeling capacity and often fails to capture complicated dependencies
in long sequences. To tackle this challenge, we propose MASFormer, an
easy-to-implement transformer variant with Mixed Attention Spans. Specifically,
MASFormer is equipped with full attention to capture long-range dependencies,
but only at a small number of layers. For the remaining layers, MASformer only
employs sparse attention to capture short-range dependencies. Our experiments
on natural language modeling and generation tasks show that a decoder-only
MASFormer model of 1.3B parameters can achieve competitive performance to
vanilla transformers with full attention while significantly reducing
computational cost (up to 75%). Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness
of continual training with long sequence data and how sequence length impacts
downstream generation performance, which may be of independent interest.

retrieval algorithms and the LLM hallucination problem. Aiming to create a
"PageRank" for the LLM era, we strive to transform LLM into a relevant,

Generator, Validator, and Optimizer, each focusing on generating trustworthy
online sources, verifying source reliability, and refining unreliable sources,

<span><p>Pretrained language models are expected to effectively map input text to a
set of vectors while preserving the inherent relationships within the text.
Consequently, designing a white-box model to compute metrics that reflect the

approach for post-hoc interpretability analysis of pretrained language models.
However, achieving interpretability in white-box models and ensuring the rigor
of metric computation becomes challenging when the source model lacks inherent
interpretability. Therefore, in this paper, we discuss striking a balance in
this trade-off and propose a novel line to constructing metrics for

specifically designed a family of metrics along this line of investigation, and
the model used to compute these metrics is referred to as the tree topological

<span><p>Scaling analysis is a technique in computational political science that
assigns a political actor (e.g. politician or party) a score on a predefined
scale based on a (typically long) body of text (e.g. a parliamentary speech or
an election manifesto). For example, political scientists have often used the
left--right scale to systematically analyse political landscapes of different
countries. NLP methods for automatic scaling analysis can find broad
application provided they (i) are able to deal with long texts and (ii) work
robustly across domains and languages. In this work, we implement and compare
two approaches to automatic scaling analysis of political-party manifestos:
label aggregation, a pipeline strategy relying on annotations of individual
statements from the manifestos, and long-input-Transformer-based models, which
compute scaling values directly from raw text. We carry out the analysis of the
Comparative Manifestos Project dataset across 41 countries and 27 languages and
find that the task can be efficiently solved by state-of-the-art models, with
label aggregation producing the best results.

<span><p>In many real-world scenarios (e.g., academic networks, social platforms),
different types of entities are not only associated with texts but also
connected by various relationships, which can be abstracted as Text-Attributed
Heterogeneous Graphs (TAHGs). Current pretraining tasks for Language Models
(LMs) primarily focus on separately learning the textual information of each
entity and overlook the crucial aspect of capturing topological connections
among entities in TAHGs. In this paper, we present a new pretraining framework
for LMs that explicitly considers the topological and heterogeneous information
in TAHGs. Firstly, we define a context graph as neighborhoods of a target node
within specific orders and propose a topology-aware pretraining task to predict
nodes involved in the context graph by jointly optimizing an LM and an
auxiliary heterogeneous graph neural network. Secondly, based on the
observation that some nodes are text-rich while others have little text, we
devise a text augmentation strategy to enrich textless nodes with their
neighbors' texts for handling the imbalance issue. We conduct link prediction
and node classification tasks on three datasets from various domains.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing
methods and the rationality of each design. Our code is available at

<span><p>Existing sentence ordering approaches generally employ encoder-decoder
frameworks with the pointer net to recover the coherence by recurrently
predicting each sentence step-by-step. Such an autoregressive manner only
leverages unilateral dependencies during decoding and cannot fully explore the

limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel Non-Autoregressive Ordering
Network, dubbed \textit{NAON}, which explores bilateral dependencies between
sentences and predicts the sentence for each position in parallel. We claim
that the non-autoregressive manner is not just applicable but also particularly
suitable to the sentence ordering task because of two peculiar characteristics
of the task: 1) each generation target is in deterministic length, and 2) the
sentences and positions should match exclusively. Furthermore, to address the
repetition issue of the naive non-autoregressive Transformer, we introduce an
exclusive loss to constrain the exclusiveness between positions and sentences.
To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct extensive

powerful for model-as-a-service usage. However, the discrete nature and the
complexity of combinatorial optimization hinder the efficiency of modern

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recent Language Models (LMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating
texts with the knowledge internalized in parameters. Yet, LMs often generate
the factually incorrect responses to the given queries, since their knowledge
may be inaccurate, incomplete, and outdated. To address this problem, previous
works propose to augment LMs with the knowledge retrieved from an external
knowledge source. However, such approaches often show suboptimal text
generation performance due to two reasons: 1) the model may fail to retrieve
the knowledge relevant to the given query, or 2) the model may not faithfully
reflect the retrieved knowledge in the generated text. To overcome these, we
propose to verify the output and the knowledge of the knowledge-augmented LMs
with a separate verifier, which is a small LM that is trained to detect those
two types of errors through instruction-finetuning. Then, when the verifier
recognizes an error, we can rectify it by either retrieving new knowledge or
generating new text. Further, we use an ensemble of the outputs from different
instructions with a single verifier to enhance the reliability of the
verification processes. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed
verification steps on multiple question answering benchmarks, whose results
show that the proposed verifier effectively identifies retrieval and generation
errors, allowing LMs to provide more factually correct outputs. Our code is

<span><p>In the era of advanced artificial intelligence and human-computer
interaction, identifying emotions in spoken language is paramount. This
research explores the integration of deep learning techniques in speech emotion
recognition, offering a comprehensive solution to the challenges associated
with speaker diarization and emotion identification. It introduces a framework
that combines a pre-existing speaker diarization pipeline and an emotion
identification model built on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve
higher precision. The proposed model was trained on data from five speech
emotion datasets, namely, RAVDESS, CREMA-D, SAVEE, TESS, and Movie Clips, out
of which the latter is a speech emotion dataset created specifically for this
research. The features extracted from each sample include Mel Frequency
Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR), Root Mean Square (RMS),
and various data augmentation algorithms like pitch, noise, stretch, and shift.
This feature extraction approach aims to enhance prediction accuracy while
reducing computational complexity. The proposed model yields an unweighted
accuracy of 63%, demonstrating remarkable efficiency in accurately identifying
emotional states within speech signals.

quantitative measures of absolute and relative equivalence in system

performance disparities depend on a number of factors: the nature of the ToD

methods from narratology and inferential statistics. Both crowdworkers and
large language models responded to identical prompts about creating and falling

direct comparison between human and LLM-generated storytelling. Responses to
the Pygmalionesque prompts confirm the pervasive presence of the Pygmalion myth
in the collective imaginary of both humans and large language models. All
solicited narratives present a scientific or technological pursuit. The
analysis reveals that narratives from GPT-3.5 and particularly GPT-4 are more
more progressive in terms of gender roles and sexuality than those written by

they offer less imaginative scenarios and rhetoric than human-authored texts.

example-based Hypernetwork adaptation: a T5 encoder-decoder initially generates
a unique signature from an input example, embedding it within the source
domains' semantic space. This signature is subsequently utilized by a
Hypernetwork to generate the task classifier's weights. We evaluated our method
across two tasks - sentiment classification and natural language inference - in
29 adaptation scenarios, where it outpaced established algorithms. In an
advanced version, the signature also enriches the input example's

<span><p>Two key obstacles in biomedical relation extraction (RE) are the scarcity of

biomedical RE as a multi-class classification task, often result in poor
generalization in low-resource settings and do not have the ability to make
selective prediction on unknown cases but give a guess from seen relations,
hindering the applicability of those approaches. We present NBR, which converts
biomedical RE as natural language inference formulation through indirect
supervision. By converting relations to natural language hypotheses, NBR is
capable of exploiting semantic cues to alleviate annotation scarcity. By
incorporating a ranking-based loss that implicitly calibrates abstinent
instances, NBR learns a clearer decision boundary and is instructed to abstain
on uncertain instances. Extensive experiments on three widely-used biomedical
RE benchmarks, namely ChemProt, DDI and GAD, verify the effectiveness of NBR in

infer the tail entity given the head entity and a certain relation. Existing
approaches also consider the neighborhood of the head entity. However, these
methods tend to model the neighborhood using a flat structure and are only
restricted to 1-hop neighbors. In this work, we propose a node
neighborhood-enhanced framework for knowledge graph completion. It models the
head entity neighborhood from multiple hops using graph neural networks to
enrich the head node information. Moreover, we introduce an additional edge
link prediction task to improve KGC. Evaluation on two public datasets shows
that this framework is simple yet effective. The case study also shows that the

<span><p>Advances in the field of vision-language contrastive learning have made it
possible for many downstream applications to be carried out efficiently and
accurately by simply taking the dot product between image and text
representations. One of the most representative approaches proposed recently
known as CLIP has garnered widespread adoption due to its effectiveness. CLIP
is trained with an InfoNCE loss that takes into account both positive and
negative samples to help learn a much more robust representation space. This
paper reveals that the common downstream practice of taking a dot product is
only a zeroth-order approximation of the optimization goal, resulting in a loss
of information during test-time. Intuitively, since the model has been
optimized based on the InfoNCE loss, test-time procedures should also be in
alignment. The question lies in how one can retrieve any semblance of negative
samples information during inference in a computationally efficient way. To
this end, we propose Distribution Normalization (DN), where we approximate the
mean representation of a batch of test samples and use such a mean to represent
what would be analogous to negative samples in the InfoNCE loss. DN requires no
retraining or fine-tuning and can be effortlessly applied during inference.
Extensive experiments on a wide variety of downstream tasks exhibit a clear
advantage of DN over the dot product on top of other existing test-time

it, we perform a comprehensive study on a scalable pre-trained

slightly lower toxicity with a nontoxic retrieval database. ii) On the LM
Evaluation Harness benchmark, RETRO largely outperforms GPT on

VT can compress any existing multilingual LM to build monolingual LMs in any

<span><p>Trained with an unprecedented scale of data, large language models (LLMs)
like ChatGPT and GPT-4 exhibit the emergence of significant reasoning abilities
from model scaling. Such a trend underscored the potential of training LLMs
with unlimited language data, advancing the development of a universal embodied
agent. In this work, we introduce the NavGPT, a purely LLM-based
instruction-following navigation agent, to reveal the reasoning capability of
GPT models in complex embodied scenes by performing zero-shot sequential action
prediction for vision-and-language navigation (VLN). At each step, NavGPT takes
the textual descriptions of visual observations, navigation history, and future
explorable directions as inputs to reason the agent's current status, and makes
the decision to approach the target. Through comprehensive experiments, we
demonstrate NavGPT can explicitly perform high-level planning for navigation,
including decomposing instruction into sub-goal, integrating commonsense
knowledge relevant to navigation task resolution, identifying landmarks from
observed scenes, tracking navigation progress, and adapting to exceptions with
plan adjustment. Furthermore, we show that LLMs is capable of generating
high-quality navigational instructions from observations and actions along a
path, as well as drawing accurate top-down metric trajectory given the agent's
navigation history. Despite the performance of using NavGPT to zero-shot R2R
tasks still falling short of trained models, we suggest adapting multi-modality
inputs for LLMs to use as visual navigation agents and applying the explicit
reasoning of LLMs to benefit learning-based models.

<span><p>The prevalence and strong capability of large language models (LLMs) present
significant safety and ethical risks if exploited by malicious users. To
prevent the potentially deceptive usage of LLMs, recent works have proposed
algorithms to detect LLM-generated text and protect LLMs. In this paper, we
investigate the robustness and reliability of these LLM detectors under
adversarial attacks. We study two types of attack strategies: 1) replacing
certain words in an LLM's output with their synonyms given the context; 2)
automatically searching for an instructional prompt to alter the writing style
of the generation. In both strategies, we leverage an auxiliary LLM to generate
the word replacements or the instructional prompt. Different from previous
works, we consider a challenging setting where the auxiliary LLM can also be
protected by a detector. Experiments reveal that our attacks effectively
compromise the performance of all detectors in the study with plausible
generations, underscoring the urgent need to improve the robustness of
LLM-generated text detection systems.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained language models (PLMs)
has emerged as a highly successful approach, with training only a small number
of parameters without sacrificing performance and becoming the de-facto
learning paradigm with the increasing size of PLMs. However, existing PEFT
methods are not memory-efficient, because they still require caching most of
the intermediate activations for the gradient calculation, akin to fine-tuning.
One effective way to reduce the activation memory is to apply a reversible
model, so the intermediate activations are not necessary to be cached and can
be recomputed. Nevertheless, modifying a PLM to its reversible variant is not
straightforward, since the reversible model has a distinct architecture from
the currently released PLMs. In this paper, we first investigate what is a key
factor for the success of existing PEFT methods, and realize that it's
essential to preserve the PLM's starting point when initializing a PEFT method.
With this finding, we propose memory-efficient fine-tuning (MEFT) that inserts
adapters into a PLM, preserving the PLM's starting point and making it
reversible without additional pre-training. We evaluate MEFT on the GLUE
benchmark and five question-answering tasks with various backbones, BERT,
RoBERTa, BART and OPT. MEFT significantly reduces the activation memory up to
84% of full fine-tuning with a negligible amount of trainable parameters.
Moreover, MEFT achieves the same score on GLUE and a comparable score on the
question-answering tasks as full fine-tuning. A similar finding is also
observed for the image classification task.

we make noisy, partially aligned, and non-parallel paragraphs. We then use such
a large-scale weakly-supervised dataset for word alignment pre-training via
span prediction. Extensive experiments with various settings empirically
demonstrate that our approach, which is named WSPAlign, is an effective and
scalable way to pre-train word aligners without manual data. When fine-tuned on
standard benchmarks, WSPAlign has set a new state-of-the-art by improving upon
the best-supervised baseline by 3.3~6.1 points in F1 and 1.5~6.1 points in AER.
Furthermore, WSPAlign also achieves competitive performance compared with the
corresponding baselines in few-shot, zero-shot and cross-lingual tests, which

<span><p>Dialogue systems and large language models (LLMs) have gained considerable
attention. However, the direct utilization of LLMs as task-oriented dialogue

LLMs and explore improved approaches for leveraging their impressive abilities.
Motivated by the goal of leveraging LLMs, we propose an alternative approach
called User-Guided Response Optimization (UGRO) to combine it with a smaller
TOD model. This approach uses LLM as annotation-free user simulator to assess
dialogue responses, combining them with smaller fine-tuned end-to-end TOD
models. By utilizing the satisfaction feedback generated by LLMs, UGRO further
optimizes the supervised fine-tuned TOD model. Specifically, the TOD model
takes the dialogue history as input and, with the assistance of the user
simulator's feedback, generates high-satisfaction responses that meet the
user's requirements. Through empirical experiments on two TOD benchmarks, we
validate the effectiveness of our method. The results demonstrate that our
approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.

(variety) scores for Alternative Uses Task (AUT) responses in Chinese. Study 1
demonstrated that the latent model-rated originality factor, comprised of three
transformer-based models, strongly predicted human originality ratings, and the
model-rated flexibility strongly correlated with human flexibility ratings as
well. Criterion validity analyses indicated that model-rated originality and
flexibility positively correlated to other creativity measures, demonstrating
similar validity to human ratings. Study 2 &amp; 3 showed that TransDis effectively
distinguished participants instructed to provide creative vs. common uses

to enrich word information and incorporate positional information, positional
encoding is defined. We hypothesize that Switching Points (SPs), i.e.,

explanation's evaluation score falls below a defined threshold, the framework
iteratively refines and reassesses the explanation. Importantly, our framework
emulates the manner in which students compose explanations at the relevant

explanations generated by students with the explanations created by the
open-source large language model Vicuna-13B, a version of Vicuna-13B that had

the cosine function in the optimization objective, which has saturation zones.
To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel angle-optimized text
embedding model called AnglE. The core idea of AnglE is to introduce angle
optimization in a complex space. This novel approach effectively mitigates the
adverse effects of the saturation zone in the cosine function, which can impede
gradient and hinder optimization processes. To set up a comprehensive STS
evaluation, we experimented on existing short-text STS datasets and a newly

domain-specific STS scenarios with limited labeled data and explore how AnglE
works with LLM-annotated data. Extensive experiments were conducted on various

The results show that AnglE outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) STS models

<span><p>Pretrained multilingual encoder models can directly perform zero-shot
multilingual tasks or linguistic probing by reformulating the input examples
into cloze-style prompts. This is accomplished by predicting the probabilities
of the label words at the masked token position, without requiring any updates
to the model parameters. However, the performance of this method is limited by
the model's bias toward predicting label words which frequently occurred during
the pretraining. These words typically receive high probabilities. To address
this issue, we combine the models with calibration techniques which modify the
probabilities of label words predicted by the models. We first validate the
effectiveness of a proposed simple calibration method together with other
existing techniques on monolingual encoders in both zero- and few-shot
scenarios. We subsequently employ these calibration techniques on multilingual
encoders, resulting in substantial performance improvements across a wide range
of tasks.

<span><p>Studying language models (LMs) in terms of well-understood formalisms allows
us to precisely characterize their abilities and limitations. Previous work has
investigated the representational capacity of recurrent neural network (RNN)
LMs in terms of their capacity to recognize unweighted formal languages.
However, LMs do not describe unweighted formal languages -- rather, they define
probability distributions over strings. In this work, we study what classes of
such probability distributions RNN LMs can represent, which allows us to make
more direct statements about their capabilities. We show that simple RNNs are
equivalent to a subclass of probabilistic finite-state automata, and can thus
model a strict subset of probability distributions expressible by finite-state
models. Furthermore, we study the space complexity of representing finite-state
LMs with RNNs. We show that, to represent an arbitrary deterministic
finite-state LM with $N$ states over an alphabet $\Sigma$, an RNN requires
$\Omega\left(N |\Sigma|\right)$ neurons. These results present a first step
towards characterizing the classes of distributions RNN LMs can represent and
thus help us understand their capabilities and limitations.

<span><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback serves as a crucial bridge,
aligning large language models with human and societal values. This alignment
requires a vast corpus of human feedback to learn a reward model, which is
subsequently used to finetune language models. However, we have identified that
the reward model often finds shortcuts to bypass its intended objectives,
misleadingly assuming that humans prefer longer responses. The emergence of
length bias often induces the model to favor longer outputs, yet it doesn't
equate to an increase in helpful information within these outputs. In this
paper, we propose an innovative solution, applying the Product-of-Experts (PoE)
technique to separate reward modeling from the influence of sequence length. In
our framework, the main expert concentrates on understanding human intents,
while the biased expert targets the identification and capture of length bias.
To further enhance the learning of bias, we introduce perturbations into the
bias-focused expert, disrupting the flow of semantic information. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our approach, indicating that language
model performance is improved, irrespective of sequence length.

<span><p>Document-level event argument extraction poses new challenges of long input
and cross-sentence inference compared to its sentence-level counterpart.
However, most prior works focus on capturing the relations between candidate
arguments and the event trigger in each event, ignoring two crucial points: a)
non-argument contextual clue information; b) the relevance among argument
roles. In this paper, we propose a SCPRG (Span-trigger-based Contextual Pooling
and latent Role Guidance) model, which contains two novel and effective modules
for the above problem. The Span-Trigger-based Contextual Pooling(STCP)
adaptively selects and aggregates the information of non-argument clue words
based on the context attention weights of specific argument-trigger pairs from
pre-trained model. The Role-based Latent Information Guidance (RLIG) module
constructs latent role representations, makes them interact through
role-interactive encoding to capture semantic relevance, and merges them into
candidate arguments. Both STCP and RLIG introduce no more than 1% new
parameters compared with the base model and can be easily applied to other
event extraction models, which are compact and transplantable. Experiments on
two public datasets show that our SCPRG outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods, with 1.13 F1 and 2.64 F1 improvements on RAMS and WikiEvents

Our proposed prompting method KQG-CoT first retrieves supportive logical forms

logical form. Then, we write a prompt to explicit the reasoning chain of
generating complicated questions based on the selected demonstrations. To
further ensure prompt quality, we extend KQG-CoT into KQG-CoT+ via sorting the
logical forms by their complexity. We conduct extensive experiments over three

that adding additional tasks yields emergent synergies that the model exploits
in improving overall performance, beyond what would be possible by training a
model on each dataset alone. Case studies are presented to validate the method,
yielding protein designs specifically focused on structural proteins, but also
exploring the applicability in the design of soluble, antimicrobial
biomaterials. While our model is trained to ultimately perform 8 distinct
tasks, with available datasets it can be extended to solve additional problems.
In a broader sense, this work illustrates a form of multiscale modeling that
relates a set of ultimate building blocks (here, byte-level utf8 characters
that define the nature of the physical system at hand) to complex output. This
materiomic scheme captures complex emergent relationships between universal
building block and resulting properties via a synergizing learning capacity to
express a set of potentialities embedded in the knowledge used in training, via
the interplay of universality and diversity.
