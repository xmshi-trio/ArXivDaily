<span><p>E-Commerce (EC) websites provide a large amount of useful information that
exceed human cognitive processing ability. In order to help customers in
comparing alternatives when buying a product, previous studies designed opinion
summarization systems based on customer reviews. They ignored templates'
information provided by manufacturers, although these descriptive information
have much product aspects or characteristics. Therefore, this paper proposes a
methodology coined as SEOpinion (Summa-rization and Exploration of Opinions)
which provides a summary for the product aspects and spots opinion(s) regarding
them, using a combination of templates' information with the customer reviews
in two main phases. First, the Hierarchical Aspect Extraction (HAE) phase
creates a hierarchy of product aspects from the template. Subsequently, the
Hierarchical Aspect-based Opinion Summarization (HAOS) phase enriches this
hierarchy with customers' opinions; to be shown to other potential buyers. To
test the feasibility of using Deep Learning-based BERT techniques with our
approach, we have created a corpus by gathering information from the top five
EC websites for laptops. The experimental results show that Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) achieves better results (77.4% and 82.6% in terms of F1-measure
for the first and second phase) than the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and
the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14180">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Mental health diseases affect children's lives and well-beings which have
received increased attention since the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyzing psychiatric
clinical notes with topic models is critical to evaluate children's mental
status over time. However, few topic models are built for longitudinal
settings, and they fail to keep consistent topics and capture temporal
trajectories for each document. To address these challenges, we develop a
longitudinal topic model with time-invariant topics and individualized temporal
dependencies on the evolving document metadata. Our model preserves the
semantic meaning of discovered topics over time and incorporates heterogeneity
among documents. In particular, when documents can be categorized, we propose
an unsupervised topics learning approach to maximize topic heterogeneity across
different document groups. We also present an efficient variational
optimization procedure adapted for the multistage longitudinal setting. In this
case study, we apply our method to the psychiatric clinical notes from a large
tertiary pediatric hospital in Southern California and achieve a 38% increase
in the overall coherence of extracted topics. Our real data analysis reveals
that children tend to express more negative emotions during state shutdowns and
more positive when schools reopen. Furthermore, it suggests that sexual and
gender minority (SGM) children display more pronounced reactions to major
COVID-19 events and a greater sensitivity to vaccine-related news than non-SGM
children. This study examines the progression of children's mental health
during the pandemic and offers clinicians valuable insights to recognize the
disparities in children's mental health related to their sexual and gender
identities.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14183">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>While large language models (LLMs) have taken great strides towards helping
humans with a plethora of tasks like search and summarization, hallucinations
remain a major impediment towards gaining user trust. The fluency and coherence
of model generations even when hallucinating makes it difficult to detect
whether or not a model is hallucinating. In this work, we explore if the
artifacts associated with the model generations can provide hints that the
generation will contain hallucinations. Specifically, we probe LLMs at 1) the
inputs via Integrated Gradients based token attribution, 2) the outputs via the
Softmax probabilities, and 3) the internal state via self-attention and
fully-connected layer activations for signs of hallucinations on open-ended
question answering tasks. Our results show that the distributions of these
artifacts differ between hallucinated and non-hallucinated generations.
Building on this insight, we train binary classifiers that use these artifacts
as input features to classify model generations into hallucinations and
non-hallucinations. These hallucination classifiers achieve up to 0.80 AUROC.
We further show that tokens preceding a hallucination can predict the
subsequent hallucination before it occurs.

mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from discharge summaries and examines instances
where the models' responses were misaligned with their reasoning. Utilizing the
MIMIC-IV v2.2 database, we focused on a cohort aged 65 and older, verifying MCI
diagnoses against ICD codes and expert evaluations. The data was partitioned
into training, validation, and testing sets in a 7:2:1 ratio for model
fine-tuning and evaluation, with an additional metastatic cancer dataset from
MIMIC III used to further assess reasoning consistency. GPT-4 demonstrated
superior interpretative capabilities, particularly in response to complex

open-source models like Falcon and LLaMA 2 achieved high accuracy but lacked
explanatory reasoning, underscoring the necessity for further research to
optimize both performance and interpretability. The study emphasizes the
significance of prompt engineering and the need for further exploration into
the unexpected reasoning-response misalignment observed in GPT-4. The results
underscore the promise of incorporating LLMs into healthcare diagnostics,

callers, residents in critical need of assistance through 911 will receive a
fast and effective response. Collaborating with the Department of Emergency

recordings and developed Auto311, the first automated system to handle 311
non-emergency calls, which (1) effectively and dynamically predicts ongoing
non-emergency incident types to generate tailored case reports during the call;
(2) itemizes essential information from dialogue contexts to complete the
generated reports; and (3) strategically structures system-caller dialogues
with optimized confidence. We used real-world data to evaluate the system's
effectiveness and deployability. The experimental results indicate that the
system effectively predicts incident type with an average F-1 score of 92.54%.
Moreover, the system successfully itemizes critical information from relevant
contexts to complete reports, evincing a 0.93 average consistency score

<span><p>Recent work demonstrates that, after being fine-tuned on a high-quality

address a wide range of tasks. However, existing methods for instruction data
generation often produce duplicate data and are not controllable enough on data
quality. In this paper, we extend the generalization of instruction tuning by
classifying the instruction data to 4 code-related tasks and propose a
LLM-based Generator-Discriminator data process framework to generate diverse,
high-quality instruction data from open source code. Hence, we introduce
CodeOcean, a dataset comprising 20,000 instruction instances across 4 universal
code-related tasks,which is aimed at augmenting the effectiveness of
instruction tuning and improving the generalization ability of fine-tuned

Widespread And Versatile Enhanced instruction tuning. This model is
specifically designed for enhancing instruction tuning of Code Language Models
(LLMs). Our experiments demonstrate that Wavecoder models outperform other
open-source models in terms of generalization ability across different
code-related tasks at the same level of fine-tuning scale. Moreover, Wavecoder
exhibits high efficiency in previous code generation tasks. This paper thus

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14197">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recent remarkable advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to
their widespread adoption in various applications. A key feature of these
applications is the combination of LLMs with external content, where user
instructions and third-party content are combined to create prompts for LLM
processing. These applications, however, are vulnerable to indirect prompt
injection attacks, where malicious instructions embedded within external
content compromise LLM's output, causing their responses to deviate from user
expectations. Despite the discovery of this security issue, no comprehensive
analysis of indirect prompt injection attacks on different LLMs is available
due to the lack of a benchmark. Furthermore, no effective defense has been
proposed.
</p>
<p>In this work, we introduce the first benchmark, BIPIA, to measure the
robustness of various LLMs and defenses against indirect prompt injection
attacks. Our experiments reveal that LLMs with greater capabilities exhibit
more vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks for text tasks, resulting
in a higher ASR. We hypothesize that indirect prompt injection attacks are
mainly due to the LLMs' inability to distinguish between instructions and
external content. Based on this conjecture, we propose four black-box methods
based on prompt learning and a white-box defense methods based on fine-tuning
with adversarial training to enable LLMs to distinguish between instructions
and external content and ignore instructions in the external content. Our
experimental results show that our black-box defense methods can effectively
reduce ASR but cannot completely thwart indirect prompt injection attacks,
while our white-box defense method can reduce ASR to nearly zero with little
adverse impact on the LLM's performance on general tasks. We hope that our
benchmark and defenses can inspire future work in this important area.

<span><p>This study explores the idea of AI Personality or AInality suggesting that
Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit patterns similar to human personalities.
Assuming that LLMs share these patterns with humans, we investigate using
human-centered psychometric tests such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator
(MBTI), Big Five Inventory (BFI), and Short Dark Triad (SD3) to identify and
confirm LLM personality types. By introducing role-play prompts, we demonstrate
the adaptability of LLMs, showing their ability to switch dynamically between
different personality types. Using projective tests, such as the Washington
University Sentence Completion Test (WUSCT), we uncover hidden aspects of LLM
personalities that are not easily accessible through direct questioning.
Projective tests allowed for a deep exploration of LLMs cognitive processes and
thought patterns and gave us a multidimensional view of AInality. Our machine
learning analysis revealed that LLMs exhibit distinct AInality traits and
manifest diverse personality types, demonstrating dynamic shifts in response to
external instructions. This study pioneers the application of projective tests

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Large language models (LLMs) can produce long, coherent passages of text,
suggesting that LLMs, although trained on next-word prediction, must represent
the latent structure that characterizes a document. Prior work has found that
internal representations of LLMs encode one aspect of latent structure, namely
syntax; here we investigate a complementary aspect, namely the document's topic
structure. We motivate the hypothesis that LLMs capture topic structure by
connecting LLM optimization to implicit Bayesian inference. De Finetti's
theorem shows that exchangeable probability distributions can be represented as
a mixture with respect to a latent generating distribution. Although text is
not exchangeable at the level of syntax, exchangeability is a reasonable
starting assumption for topic structure. We thus hypothesize that predicting
the next token in text will lead LLMs to recover latent topic distributions. We
examine this hypothesis using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an
exchangeable probabilistic topic model, as a target, and we show that the
representations formed by LLMs encode both the topics used to generate
synthetic data and those used to explain natural corpus data.

However, most tags are only focused on the technical perspective (e.g., program

Furthermore, inspired by our manual study, we design a pre-trained

prototypical QFS pipeline consists of a retriever (sparse or dense retrieval)

to replicating CAD's experiments on news summarization datasets, we include

computational complexity and hyperparameter sensitivity. Experiments with eight
different language models show that performance-wise, CAD improves QFS quality
by (1) reducing factuality errors/hallucinations while (2) mostly retaining the

<span><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in Metaverse
environments to generate dynamic and realistic content and to control the
behavior of non-player characters (NPCs). However, the cybersecurity concerns
associated with LLMs have become increasingly prominent. Previous research has
primarily focused on patching system vulnerabilities to enhance cybersecurity,
but these approaches are not well-suited to the Metaverse, where the virtual
space is more complex, LLMs are vulnerable, and ethical user interaction is
critical. Moreover, the scope of cybersecurity in the Metaverse is expected to
expand significantly. This paper proposes a method for enhancing cybersecurity
through the simulation of user interaction with LLMs. Our goal is to educate
users and strengthen their defense capabilities through exposure to a
comprehensive simulation system. This system includes extensive Metaverse
cybersecurity Q&amp;A and attack simulation scenarios. By engaging with these,
users will improve their ability to recognize and withstand risks.
Additionally, to address the ethical implications of user input, we propose
using LLMs as evaluators to assess user content across five dimensions. We
further adapt the models through vocabulary expansion training to better
understand personalized inputs and emoticons. We conduct experiments on
multiple LLMs and find that our approach is effective.

<span><p>The primary objective of simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) is to
minimize latency while preserving the quality of the final translation. Drawing
inspiration from CPU branch prediction techniques, we propose incorporating
branch prediction techniques in SiMT tasks to reduce translation latency.
Specifically, we utilize a language model as a branch predictor to predict
potential branch directions, namely, future source words. Subsequently, we
utilize the predicted source words to decode the output in advance. When the
actual source word deviates from the predicted source word, we use the real
source word to decode the output again, replacing the predicted output. To
further reduce computational costs, we share the parameters of the encoder and
the branch predictor, and utilize a pre-trained language model for
initialization. Our proposed method can be seamlessly integrated with any SiMT
model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach can improve
translation quality and latency at the same time. Our code is available at

<span><p>Equivariance is an important feature in machine learning, including language
models. It ensures that any sequences of phrases with the same meanings are
interpreted consistently. For example, the sentence 'There is a cat on the
table' should be interpreted by language models as it is, regardless of
variations in its token-level expression. Building on this insight, I propose a
new theory suggesting that insufficient equivariance in language models can
lead to hallucinations. According to this theory, which is both intuitive and
novel, language models trained on relatively small datasets tend to
misinterpret input texts and/or generate incorrect texts (i.e.,
hallucinations). To test this theory, I developed a toy model known as 'dancing
men', which is a character-level substitution cipher. Additionally, I propose a
novel technique based on the T5 (Text To Text Transfer Transformer) model to
efficiently decipher these codes without relying on frequency analysis. I have
found that this T5 model can almost completely solve the cipher, demonstrating
its ability to acquire equivariance in this frame. This method could be scaled
up to word-level and sentence-level substitution ciphers, analogous to large
language models without tokenizers or dictionaries. This scalability makes it
suitable for investigating the proposed link between inadequate equivariance
acquisition and the emergence of hallucinations.

The question arises naturally: can we use language feedback to align large

alignment through the lens of language feedback (i.e., judgment). We commence
with an in-depth investigation of potential methods that can be adapted for

generation process as a probabilistic graphical model and tightly connect
different types of events by modeling the latent health states. Then, we derive
a health state inference method tailored for the multi-visit scenario to

Furthermore, we propose to generate medical reports to add textual descriptions

<p>To operationalise this metric, we engaged in a multi-step process involving
collecting and annotating LLM responses, applying sophisticated Natural

LLMBI score through a specially crafted mathematical formula. The formula
integrates weighted averages of various bias dimensions, a penalty for dataset

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07662">

<span><p>Our goal is a modern approach to answering questions via systematic reasoning
where answers are supported by human interpretable proof trees grounded in an
NL corpus of authoritative facts. Such a system would help alleviate the
challenges of interpretability and hallucination with modern LMs, and the lack
of grounding of current explanation methods (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). This
paper proposes a new take on Prolog-based inference engines, where we replace
handcrafted rules with a combination of neural language modeling, guided
generation, and semiparametric dense retrieval. Our implementation, NELLIE, is
the first system to demonstrate fully interpretable, end-to-end grounded QA as
entailment tree proof search, going beyond earlier work explaining
known-to-be-true facts from text. In experiments, NELLIE outperforms a
similar-sized state-of-the-art reasoner [Tafjord et al., 2022] while producing
knowledge-grounded explanations. We also find NELLIE can exploit both
semi-structured and NL text corpora to guide reasoning. Together these suggest
a new way to jointly reap the benefits of both modern neural methods and
traditional symbolic reasoning.

<span><p>Prompting approaches have been recently explored in text style transfer,
where a textual prompt is used to query a pretrained language model to generate
style-transferred texts word by word in an autoregressive manner. However, such
a generation process is less controllable and early prediction errors may
affect future word predictions. In this paper, we present a prompt-based
editing approach for text style transfer. Specifically, we prompt a pretrained
language model for style classification and use the classification probability
to compute a style score. Then, we perform discrete search with word-level
editing to maximize a comprehensive scoring function for the style-transfer
task. In this way, we transform a prompt-based generation problem into a
classification one, which is a training-free process and more controllable than
the autoregressive generation of sentences. In our experiments, we performed
both automatic and human evaluation on three style-transfer benchmark datasets,
and show that our approach largely outperforms the state-of-the-art systems
that have 20 times more parameters. Additional empirical analyses further
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<span><p>The emergence of ChatGPT has recently garnered significant attention from the
computational linguistics community. To demonstrate its capabilities as a
keyphrase generator, we conduct a preliminary evaluation of ChatGPT for the
keyphrase generation task. We evaluate its performance in various aspects,
including keyphrase generation prompts, keyphrase generation diversity, and
long document understanding. Our evaluation is based on six benchmark datasets,
and we adopt the prompt suggested by OpenAI while extending it to six candidate
prompts. We find that ChatGPT performs exceptionally well on all six candidate
prompts, with minor performance differences observed across the datasets. Based
on our findings, we conclude that ChatGPT has great potential for keyphrase
generation. Moreover, we discover that ChatGPT still faces challenges when it
comes to generating absent keyphrases. Meanwhile, in the final section, we also

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14171">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Large language models are able to learn new tasks in context, where they are
provided with instructions and a few annotated examples. However, the
effectiveness of in-context learning is dependent on the provided context, and
the performance on a downstream task can vary considerably, depending on the
instruction. Importantly, such dependency on the context can surface in
unpredictable ways, e.g., a seemingly more informative instruction might lead
to a worse performance. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach,
which we term In-Context Probing (ICP). Similar to in-context learning, we
contextualize the representation of the input with an instruction, but instead
of decoding the output prediction, we probe the contextualized representation
to predict the label. Through a series of experiments on a diverse set of
classification tasks, we show that in-context probing is significantly more
robust to changes in instructions. We further show that ICP performs
competitive or superior to finetuning and can be particularly helpful to build
classifiers on top of smaller models, with less than a hundred training
examples.

<span><p>Automatic melody-to-lyric generation is a task in which song lyrics are
generated to go with a given melody. It is of significant practical interest
and more challenging than unconstrained lyric generation as the music imposes

songs are copyrighted, resulting in models that underfit the complicated
cross-modal relationship between melody and lyrics. In this work, we propose a
method for generating high-quality lyrics without training on any aligned
melody-lyric data. Specifically, we design a hierarchical lyric generation
framework that first generates a song outline and second the complete lyrics.
The framework enables disentanglement of training (based purely on text) from
inference (melody-guided text generation) to circumvent the shortage of
parallel data.
</p>
<p>We leverage the segmentation and rhythm alignment between melody and lyrics
to compile the given melody into decoding constraints as guidance during
inference. The two-step hierarchical design also enables content control via
the lyric outline, a much-desired feature for democratizing collaborative song
creation. Experimental results show that our model can generate high-quality
lyrics that are more on-topic, singable, intelligible, and coherent than strong
baselines, for example SongMASS, a SOTA model trained on a parallel dataset,
with a 24% relative overall quality improvement based on human ratings.

<span><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently attracted considerable interest
for their ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, such as chain-of-thought
reasoning. However, most of the existing approaches to enhance this ability
rely heavily on data-driven methods, while neglecting the structural aspects of
the model's reasoning capacity. We find that while LLMs can manage individual
reasoning steps well, they struggle with maintaining consistency across an
entire reasoning chain. To solve this, we introduce 'planning tokens' at the
start of each reasoning step, serving as a guide for the model. These token
embeddings are then fine-tuned along with the rest of the model parameters. Our
approach requires a negligible increase in trainable parameters (just 0.001%)
and can be applied through either full fine-tuning or a more
parameter-efficient scheme. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness by
applying it to three different LLMs, showing notable accuracy improvements
across three math word problem datasets w.r.t. plain chain-of-thought
fine-tuning baselines.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>In the quest to advance human-centric natural language generation (NLG)
systems, ensuring alignment between NLG models and human preferences is
crucial. For this alignment, current popular methods leverage a reinforcement
learning (RL) approach with a reward model trained on feedback from humans.
However, inherent disagreements due to the subjective nature of human
preferences pose a significant challenge for training the reward model,
resulting in a deterioration of the NLG performance. To tackle this issue,
previous approaches typically rely on majority voting or averaging to
consolidate multiple inconsistent preferences into a merged one. Although
straightforward to understand and execute, such methods suffer from an
inability to capture the nuanced degrees of disaggregation among humans and may
only represent a specialized subset of individuals, thereby lacking the ability
to quantitatively disclose the universality of human preferences. To address
this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach, which employs a Bayesian
framework to account for the distribution of disagreements among human
preferences as training a preference model, and names it as d-PM. Besides,
considering the RL strategy's inefficient and complex training process over the
training efficiency, we further propose utilizing the contrastive learning
strategy to train the NLG model with the preference scores derived from the
d-PM model. Extensive experiments on two human-centric NLG tasks, i.e.,
emotional support conversation and integrity "Rule-of-Thumb" generation, show
that our method consistently exceeds previous SOTA models in both automatic and
human evaluations.

<span><p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited considerable cross-lingual
generalization abilities, whereby they implicitly transfer knowledge across
languages. However, the transfer is not equally successful for all languages,
especially for low-resource ones, which poses an ongoing challenge. It is
unclear whether we have reached the limits of implicit cross-lingual
generalization and if explicit knowledge transfer is viable. In this paper, we
investigate the potential for explicitly aligning conceptual correspondence
between languages to enhance cross-lingual generalization. Using the syntactic
aspect of language as a testbed, our analyses of 43 languages reveal a high
degree of alignability among the spaces of structural concepts within each
language for both encoder-only and decoder-only LLMs. We then propose a
meta-learning-based method to learn to align conceptual spaces of different
languages, which facilitates zero-shot and few-shot generalization in concept
classification and also offers insights into the cross-lingual in-context
learning phenomenon. Experiments on syntactic analysis tasks show that our
approach achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art methods and narrows
the performance gap between languages, particularly benefiting those with

<span><p>Existing open-vocabulary image segmentation methods require a fine-tuning
step on mask annotations and/or image-text datasets. Mask labels are
labor-intensive, which limits the number of categories in segmentation

severely reduced after fine-tuning. However, without fine-tuning, VLMs trained
under weak image-text supervision tend to make suboptimal mask predictions when
there are text queries referring to non-existing concepts in the image. To
alleviate these issues, we introduce a novel recurrent framework that
progressively filters out irrelevant texts and enhances mask quality without
training efforts. The recurrent unit is a two-stage segmenter built upon a VLM
with frozen weights. Thus, our model retains the VLM's broad vocabulary space
and strengthens its segmentation capability. Experimental results show that our
method outperforms not only the training-free counterparts, but also those
fine-tuned with millions of additional data samples, and sets new
