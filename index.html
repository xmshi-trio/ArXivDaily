<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16897">

<span><p>The growing capabilities of transformer models pave the way for solving
increasingly complex NLP tasks. A key to supporting application-specific
requirements is the ability to fine-tune. However, compiling a fine-tuning
dataset tailored to complex tasks is tedious and results in large datasets,
limiting the ability to control transformer output. We present an approach in
which complex tasks are divided into simpler subtasks. Multiple transformer
models are fine-tuned to one subtask each, and lined up to accomplish the
complex task. This simplifies the compilation of fine-tuning datasets and
increases overall controllability. Using the example of reducing gender bias as
a complex task, we demonstrate our approach and show that it performs better
than using a single model.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16924">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>A major challenge in the practical use of Machine Translation (MT) is that
users lack guidance to make informed decisions about when to rely on outputs.
Progress in quality estimation research provides techniques to automatically
assess MT quality, but these techniques have primarily been evaluated in vitro
by comparison against human judgments outside of a specific context of use.
This paper evaluates quality estimation feedback in vivo with a human study
simulating decision-making in high-stakes medical settings. Using Emergency
Department discharge instructions, we study how interventions based on quality
estimation versus backtranslation assist physicians in deciding whether to show
MT outputs to a patient. We find that quality estimation improves appropriate
reliance on MT, but backtranslation helps physicians detect more clinically
harmful errors that QE alone often misses.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16931">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Modern multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems like Whisper
have made it possible to transcribe audio in multiple languages with a single
model. However, current state-of-the-art ASR models are typically evaluated on
individual languages or in a multi-task setting, overlooking the challenge of
continually learning new languages. There is insufficient research on how to
add new languages without losing valuable information from previous data.
Furthermore, existing continual learning benchmarks focus mostly on vision and
language tasks, leaving continual learning for multilingual ASR largely
unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose CL-MASR, a benchmark designed for
studying multilingual ASR in a continual learning setting. CL-MASR provides a
diverse set of continual learning methods implemented on top of large-scale
pretrained ASR models, along with common metrics to assess the effectiveness of
learning new languages while addressing the issue of catastrophic forgetting.
To the best of our knowledge, CL-MASR is the first continual learning benchmark
for the multilingual ASR task. The code is available at

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16937">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently become remarkably good at
improving developer productivity for high-resource programming languages. These
models use two kinds of data: large amounts of unlabeled code samples for
pretraining and relatively smaller amounts of labeled code samples for
fine-tuning or in-context learning. Unfortunately, many programming languages
are low-resource, lacking labeled samples for most tasks and often even lacking
unlabeled samples. Therefore, users of low-resource languages (e.g., legacy or
new languages) miss out on the benefits of LLMs. Cross-lingual transfer
learning uses data from a source language to improve model performance on a
target language. It has been well-studied for natural languages, but has
received little attention for programming languages. This paper reports
extensive experiments on four tasks using a transformer-based LLM and 11 to 41
programming languages to explore the following questions. First, how well
cross-lingual transfer works for a given task across different language pairs.
Second, given a task and target language, how to best choose a source language.
Third, the characteristics of a language pair that are predictive of transfer
performance, and fourth, how that depends on the given task.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>We aim to produce a smaller language model that is aligned to user intent.
Previous research has shown that applying distilled supervised fine-tuning
(dSFT) on larger models significantly improves task accuracy; however, these
models are unaligned, i.e. they do not respond well to natural prompts. To
distill this property, we experiment with the use of preference data from AI
Feedback (AIF). Starting from a dataset of outputs ranked by a teacher model,
we apply distilled direct preference optimization (dDPO) to learn a chat model
with significantly improved intent alignment. The approach requires only a few
hours of training without any additional sampling during fine-tuning. The final
result, Zephyr-7B, sets the state-of-the-art on chat benchmarks for 7B
parameter models, and requires no human annotation. In particular, results on
MT-Bench show that Zephyr-7B surpasses Llama2-Chat-70B, the best open-access
RLHF-based model. Code, models, data, and tutorials for the system are

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16964">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Hallucination of text ungrounded in the input is a well-known problem in
neural data-to-text generation. Many methods have been proposed to mitigate it,
but they typically require altering model architecture or collecting additional
data, and thus cannot be easily applied to an existing model. In this paper, we
explore a new way to mitigate hallucinations by combining the probabilistic
output of a generator language model (LM) with the output of a special "text
critic" classifier, which guides the generation by assessing the match between
the input data and the text generated so far. Our method does not need any
changes to the underlying LM's architecture or training procedure and can thus
be combined with any model and decoding operating on word probabilities. The
critic does not need any additional training data, using the base LM's training
data and synthetic negative examples. Our experimental results show that our
method improves over the baseline on the WebNLG and OpenDialKG benchmarks.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16968">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Social structures and real-world incidents often influence contemporary
literary fiction. Existing research in literary fiction analysis explains these
real-world phenomena through the manual critical analysis of stories.
Conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies, including
sentiment analysis, narrative summarization, and topic modeling, have
demonstrated substantial efficacy in analyzing and identifying similarities
within fictional works. However, the intricate dynamics of character
interactions within fiction necessitate a more nuanced approach that
incorporates visualization techniques. Character interaction graphs (or
networks) emerge as a highly suitable means for visualization and information
retrieval from the realm of fiction. Therefore, we leverage character
interaction graphs with NLP-derived features to explore a diverse spectrum of
societal inquiries about contemporary culture's impact on the landscape of
literary fiction. Our study involves constructing character interaction graphs
from fiction, extracting relevant graph features, and exploiting these features
to resolve various real-life queries. Experimental evaluation of influential
Bengali fiction over half a century demonstrates that character interaction
graphs can be highly effective in specific assessments and information
retrieval from literary fiction. Our data and codebase are available at

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16990">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>In the context of a voice assistant system, steering refers to the phenomenon
in which a user issues a follow-up command attempting to direct or clarify a
previous turn. We propose STEER, a steering detection model that predicts
whether a follow-up turn is a user's attempt to steer the previous command.
Constructing a training dataset for steering use cases poses challenges due to
the cold-start problem. To overcome this, we developed heuristic rules to
sample opt-in usage data, approximating positive and negative samples without
any annotation. Our experimental results show promising performance in
identifying steering intent, with over 95% accuracy on our sampled data.
Moreover, STEER, in conjunction with our sampling strategy, aligns effectively
with real-world steering scenarios, as evidenced by its strong zero-shot
performance on a human-graded evaluation set. In addition to relying solely on
user transcripts as input, we introduce STEER+, an enhanced version of the
model. STEER+ utilizes a semantic parse tree to provide more context on
out-of-vocabulary words, such as named entities that often occur at the
sentence boundary. This further improves model performance, reducing error rate
in domains where entities frequently appear, such as messaging. Lastly, we
present a data analysis that highlights the improvement in user experience when
voice assistants support steering use cases.

<span><p>Domain adaptation, the process of training a model in one domain and applying

training a domain-specific foundation model (FM) from scratch is an option,
recent methods have focused on adapting pre-trained FMs for domain-specific
tasks. However, our experiments reveal that either approach does not
consistently achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in the target domain. In
this work, we study extractive question answering within closed domains and
introduce the concept of targeted pre-training. This involves determining and
generating relevant data to further pre-train our models, as opposed to the
conventional philosophy of utilizing domain-specific FMs trained on a wide
range of data. Our proposed framework uses Galactica to generate synthetic,
``targeted'' corpora that align with specific writing styles and topics, such
as research papers and radiology reports. This process can be viewed as a form
of knowledge distillation. We apply our method to two biomedical extractive
question answering datasets, COVID-QA and RadQA, achieving a new benchmark on
the former and demonstrating overall improvements on the latter. Code available

<span><p>Emotion recognition in text, the task of identifying emotions such as joy or

taxonomies and display imbalance in their emotion distribution. In this work,
we studied the impact of data augmentation techniques precisely when applied to
small imbalanced datasets, for which current state-of-the-art models (such as
RoBERTa) under-perform. Specifically, we utilized four data augmentation
methods (Easy Data Augmentation EDA, static and contextual Embedding-based, and
ProtAugment) on three datasets that come from different sources and vary in

using the augmented data when training the classifier model leads to

and hindering the sharing of beneficial knowledge between both domains. To
bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive literature review using the PRISMA
framework, reviewing 534 papers published in both computer science and

The prefix scorer is used at inference time to steer the generation towards
higher reward outcomes. We show that the prefix scorer may be trained on
(possibly) off-policy data to predict the expected reward when decoding is
continued from a partially decoded response. We empirically demonstrate that CD
is effective as a control mechanism on Reddit conversations corpus. We also
show that the modularity of the design of CD makes it possible to control for
multiple rewards, effectively solving a multi-objective reinforcement learning
problem with no additional complexity. Finally, we show that CD can be applied
in a novel blockwise fashion at inference-time, again without the need for any

commonsensical outputs is computationally expensive if not infeasible. In this
paper, we present a computation-efficient framework that steers a frozen
Pre-Trained Language Model (PTLM) towards more commonsensical generation (i.e.,
producing a plausible output that incorporates a list of concepts in a
meaningful way). Specifically, we first construct a reference-free evaluator
that assigns a sentence with a commonsensical score by grounding the sentence
to a dynamic commonsense knowledge base from four different relational aspects.
We then use the scorer as the oracle for commonsense knowledge, and extend the
controllable generation method called NADO to train an auxiliary head that
guides a fixed PTLM to better satisfy the oracle. We test our framework on a

<span><p>Transformers are remarkably good at in-context learning (ICL) -- learning
from demonstrations without parameter updates -- but how they perform ICL
remains a mystery. Recent work suggests that Transformers may learn in-context
by internally running Gradient Descent, a first-order optimization method. In
this paper, we instead demonstrate that Transformers learn to implement
higher-order optimization methods to perform ICL. Focusing on in-context linear
regression, we show that Transformers learn to implement an algorithm very
similar to Iterative Newton's Method, a higher-order optimization method,
rather than Gradient Descent. Empirically, we show that predictions from
successive Transformer layers closely match different iterations of Newton's
Method linearly, with each middle layer roughly computing 3 iterations. In
contrast, exponentially more Gradient Descent steps are needed to match an
additional Transformers layer; this suggests that Transformers have an
comparable rate of convergence with high-order methods such as Iterative
Newton, which are exponentially faster than Gradient Descent. We also show that
Transformers can learn in-context on ill-conditioned data, a setting where
Gradient Descent struggles but Iterative Newton succeeds. Finally, we show
theoretical results which support our empirical findings and have a close

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17119">

<span><p>Detecting factual errors in textual information, whether generated by large
language models (LLM) or curated by humans, is crucial for making informed
decisions. LLMs' inability to attribute their claims to external knowledge and
their tendency to hallucinate makes it difficult to rely on their responses.
Humans, too, are prone to factual errors in their writing. Since manual
detection and correction of factual errors is labor-intensive, developing an
automatic approach can greatly reduce human effort. We present FLEEK, a
prototype tool that automatically extracts factual claims from text, gathers
evidence from external knowledge sources, evaluates the factuality of each
claim, and suggests revisions for identified errors using the collected
evidence. Initial empirical evaluation on fact error detection (77-85\% F1)
shows the potential of FLEEK. A video demo of FLEEK can be found at

<span><p>Breaking down a document or a conversation into multiple contiguous segments
based on its semantic structure is an important and challenging problem in NLP,
which can assist many downstream tasks. However, current works on topic
segmentation often focus on segmentation of structured texts. In this paper, we
comprehensively analyze the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art
topic segmentation models on unstructured texts. We find that: (a) Current
strategies of pre-training on a large corpus of structured text such as
Wiki-727K do not help in transferability to unstructured conversational data.
(b) Training from scratch with only a relatively small-sized dataset of the
target unstructured domain improves the segmentation results by a significant
margin. We stress-test our proposed Topic Segmentation approach by
experimenting with multiple loss functions, in order to mitigate effects of
imbalance in unstructured conversational datasets. Our empirical evaluation
indicates that Focal Loss function is a robust alternative to Cross-Entropy and
re-weighted Cross-Entropy loss function when segmenting unstructured and
semi-structured chats.

<span><p>Factual probing is a method that uses prompts to test if a language model
"knows" certain world knowledge facts. A problem in factual probing is that
small changes to the prompt can lead to large changes in model output. Previous
work aimed to alleviate this problem by optimizing prompts via text mining or
fine-tuning. However, such approaches are relation-specific and do not
generalize to unseen relation types. Here, we propose to use test-time
augmentation (TTA) as a relation-agnostic method for reducing sensitivity to
prompt variations by automatically augmenting and ensembling prompts at test
time. Experiments show improved model calibration, i.e., with TTA, model
confidence better reflects prediction accuracy. Improvements in prediction
accuracy are observed for some models, but for other models, TTA leads to
degradation. Error analysis identifies the difficulty of producing high-quality
prompt variations as the main challenge for TTA.

visual and textual features, which has attracted considerable attention from
both natural language processing and computer vision communities. Currently,
most comics are hand-drawn and prone to problems such as missing pages, text

Instead, we attribute this phenomenon to insufficient cross-modal interaction,

generate parallel Visual Question-Answering (VQA) style pairs from the source
text, fostering more robust cross-modal interaction. Using Large Language
Models (LLMs), we explicitly model the probing signal in MMT to convert it into
VQA-style data to create the Multi30K-VQA dataset. An MMT-VQA multitask

that MLE is not always necessary and optimal, especially for closed-ended text
generation tasks like machine translation. In these tasks, the goal of model is
to generate the most appropriate response, which does not necessarily require
it to estimate the entire data distribution with MLE. To this end, we propose a

<span><p>Understanding neural networks is challenging in part because of the dense,
continuous nature of their hidden states. We explore whether we can train
neural networks to have hidden states that are sparse, discrete, and more
interpretable by quantizing their continuous features into what we call
codebook features. Codebook features are produced by finetuning neural networks
with vector quantization bottlenecks at each layer, producing a network whose
hidden features are the sum of a small number of discrete vector codes chosen
from a larger codebook. Surprisingly, we find that neural networks can operate
under this extreme bottleneck with only modest degradation in performance. This
sparse, discrete bottleneck also provides an intuitive way of controlling
neural network behavior: first, find codes that activate when the desired
behavior is present, then activate those same codes during generation to elicit
that behavior. We validate our approach by training codebook Transformers on
several different datasets. First, we explore a finite state machine dataset
with far more hidden states than neurons. In this setting, our approach
overcomes the superposition problem by assigning states to distinct codes, and
we find that we can make the neural network behave as if it is in a different
state by activating the code for that state. Second, we train Transformer
language models with up to 410M parameters on two natural language datasets. We
identify codes in these models representing diverse, disentangled concepts
(ranging from negative emotions to months of the year) and find that we can
guide the model to generate different topics by activating the appropriate
codes during inference. Overall, codebook features appear to be a promising
unit of analysis and control for neural networks and interpretability. Our

generating high quality content, thus making it a challenging task to detect
generated text from human-written content. Despite the advantages provided by
Natural Language Generation, the inability to distinguish automatically
generated text can raise ethical concerns in terms of authenticity.
Consequently, it is important to design and develop methodologies to detect
artificial content. In our work, we present some classification models
constructed by ensembling transformer models such as Sci-BERT, DeBERTa and
XLNet, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our experiments demonstrate
that the considered ensemble architectures surpass the performance of the
individual transformer models for classification. Furthermore, the proposed
SciBERT-CNN ensemble model produced an F1-score of 98.36% on the ALTA shared
task 2023 data.

<span><p>Research in psychopathology has shown that, at an aggregate level, the
patterns of emotional change over time -- emotion dynamics -- are indicators of
one's mental health. One's patterns of emotion change have traditionally been
determined through self-reports of emotions; however, there are known issues
with accuracy, bias, and convenience. Recent approaches to determining emotion
dynamics from one's everyday utterances, addresses many of these concerns, but
it is not yet known whether these measures of utterance emotion dynamics (UED)
correlate with mental health diagnoses. Here, for the first time, we study the
relationship between tweet emotion dynamics and mental health disorders. We
find that each of the UED metrics studied varied by the user's self-disclosed
diagnosis. For example: average valence was significantly higher (i.e., more
positive text) in the control group compared to users with ADHD, MDD, and PTSD.
Valence variability was significantly lower in the control group compared to
ADHD, depression, bipolar disorder, MDD, PTSD, and OCD but not PPD. Rise and
recovery rates of valence also exhibited significant differences from the
control. This work provides important early evidence for how linguistic cues
pertaining to emotion dynamics can play a crucial role as biosocial markers for
mental illnesses and aid in the understanding, diagnosis, and management of

<span><p>This paper presents LightLM, a lightweight Transformer-based language model
for generative recommendation. While Transformer-based generative modeling has
gained importance in various AI sub-fields such as NLP and vision, generative
recommendation is still in its infancy due to its unique demand on personalized
generative modeling. Existing works on generative recommendation often use
NLP-oriented Transformer architectures such as T5, GPT, LLaMA and M6, which are
heavy-weight and are not specifically designed for recommendation tasks.
LightLM tackles the issue by introducing a light-weight deep and narrow
Transformer architecture, which is specifically tailored for direct generation
of recommendation items. This structure is especially apt for straightforward
generative recommendation and stems from the observation that language model
does not have to be too wide for this task, as the input predominantly consists
of short tokens that are well-suited for the model's capacity. We also show
that our devised user and item ID indexing methods, i.e., Spectral
Collaborative Indexing (SCI) and Graph Collaborative Indexing (GCI), enables
the deep and narrow Transformer architecture to outperform large-scale language
models for recommendation. Besides, to address the hallucination problem of
generating items as output, we propose the constrained generation process for
generative recommenders. Experiments on real-world datasets show that LightLM
outperforms various competitive baselines in terms of both recommendation
accuracy and efficiency. The code can be found at

<span><p>Pretrained machine learning models are known to perpetuate and even amplify
existing biases in data, which can result in unfair outcomes that ultimately
impact user experience. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms
behind those prejudicial biases to ensure that model performance does not
result in discriminatory behaviour toward certain groups or populations. In
this work, we define gender bias as our case study. We quantify bias
amplification in pretraining and after fine-tuning on three families of
vision-and-language models. We investigate the connection, if any, between the
two learning stages, and evaluate how bias amplification reflects on model
performance. Overall, we find that bias amplification in pretraining and after
fine-tuning are independent. We then examine the effect of continued
pretraining on gender-neutral data, finding that this reduces group
disparities, i.e., promotes fairness, on VQAv2 and retrieval tasks without
significantly compromising task performance.

<span><p>A continuous constraint satisfaction problem (CCSP) is a constraint
satisfaction problem (CSP) with an interval domain $U \subset \mathbb{R}$. We
engage in a systematic study to classify CCSPs that are complete of the
Existential Theory of the Reals, i.e., ER-complete. To define this class, we
first consider the problem ETR, which also stands for Existential Theory of the
Reals. In an instance of this problem we are given some sentence of the form
$\exists x_1, \ldots, x_n \in \mathbb{R} : \Phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, where
$\Phi$ is a well-formed quantifier-free formula consisting of the symbols $\{0,
1, +, \cdot, \geq, &gt;, \wedge, \vee, \neg\}$, the goal is to check whether this
sentence is true. Now the class ER is the family of all problems that admit a
polynomial-time many-one reduction to ETR. It is known that NP $\subseteq$ ER
$\subseteq$ PSPACE.
</p>
<p>We restrict our attention on CCSPs with addition constraints ($x + y = z$)
and some other mild technical condition. Previously, it was shown that
multiplication constraints ($x \cdot y = z$), squaring constraints ($x^2 = y$),
or inversion constraints ($x\cdot y = 1$) are sufficient to establish
ER-completeness. We extend this in the strongest possible sense for equality
constraints as follows. We show that CCSPs (with addition constraints and some
other mild technical condition) that have any one well-behaved curved equality
constraint ($f(x,y) = 0$) are ER-complete. We further extend our results to
inequality constraints. We show that any well-behaved convexly curved and any
well-behaved concavely curved inequality constraint ($f(x,y) \geq 0$ and
$g(x,y) \geq 0$) imply ER-completeness on the class of such CCSPs.

<span><p>Word co-occurrence patterns in language corpora contain a surprising amount
of conceptual knowledge. Large language models (LLMs), trained to predict words
in context, leverage these patterns to achieve impressive performance on
diverse semantic tasks requiring world knowledge. An important but understudied
question about LLMs' semantic abilities is whether they acquire generalized
knowledge of common events. Here, we test whether five pre-trained LLMs (from
2018's BERT to 2023's MPT) assign higher likelihood to plausible descriptions
of agent-patient interactions than to minimally different implausible versions
of the same event. Using three curated sets of minimal sentence pairs (total
n=1,215), we found that pre-trained LLMs possess substantial event knowledge,
outperforming other distributional language models. In particular, they almost
always assign higher likelihood to possible vs. impossible events (The teacher
bought the laptop vs. The laptop bought the teacher). However, LLMs show less
consistent preferences for likely vs. unlikely events (The nanny tutored the
boy vs. The boy tutored the nanny). In follow-up analyses, we show that (i) LLM
scores are driven by both plausibility and surface-level sentence features,
(ii) LLM scores generalize well across syntactic variants (active vs. passive
constructions) but less well across semantic variants (synonymous sentences),
(iii) some LLM errors mirror human judgment ambiguity, and (iv) sentence
plausibility serves as an organizing dimension in internal LLM representations.
Overall, our results show that important aspects of event knowledge naturally
emerge from distributional linguistic patterns, but also highlight a gap

<span><p>The breakthrough performance of large language models (LLMs) comes with major
computational footprints and high deployment costs. In this paper, we progress
towards resolving this problem by proposing a novel structured compression
approach for LLMs, called ZipLM. ZipLM achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy-vs-speedup, while matching a set of desired target runtime speedups in
any given inference environment. Specifically, given a model, a dataset, an
inference environment, as well as a set of speedup targets, ZipLM iteratively
identifies and removes components with the worst loss-runtime trade-off. Unlike
prior methods that specialize in either the post-training/one-shot or the
gradual compression setting, and only for specific families of models such as
BERT (encoder) or GPT (decoder), ZipLM produces state-of-the-art compressed
models across all these settings. Furthermore, ZipLM achieves superior results
for a fraction of the computational cost relative to prior distillation and
pruning techniques, making it a cost-effective approach for generating an
entire family of smaller, faster, and highly accurate models, guaranteed to
meet the desired inference specifications. In particular, ZipLM outperforms all
prior BERT-base distillation and pruning techniques, such as CoFi, MiniLM, and
TinyBERT. Moreover, it matches the performance of the heavily optimized
MobileBERT model, obtained via extensive architecture search, by simply pruning
the baseline BERT-large model. When compressing GPT2, ZipLM outperforms
DistilGPT2 while being 60% smaller and 30% faster. Our code is available at:

that speech representations extracted at the end of a streaming input are
significantly different from those extracted from a complete utterance. To
address this issue, we propose a new approach called Future-Aware Streaming
Translation (FAST) that adapts an offline ST model for streaming input. FAST
includes a Future-Aware Inference (FAI) strategy that incorporates future

witnessed remarkable zero-shot performance in various natural language

<span><p>Inspired by the superior language abilities of large language models (LLM),
large vision-language models (LVLM) have been recently explored by integrating
powerful LLMs for improving the performance on complex multimodal tasks.
Despite the promising progress on LVLMs, we find that LVLMs suffer from the
hallucination problem, i.e. they tend to generate objects that are inconsistent
with the target images in the descriptions. To investigate it, this work
presents the first systematic study on object hallucination of LVLMs. We
conduct the evaluation experiments on several representative LVLMs, and show
that they mostly suffer from severe object hallucination issue. We further
discuss that the visual instructions may influence the hallucination, and find
that: objects that frequently occur in the visual instructions or co-occur with
the image objects, are obviously prone to be hallucinated by LVLMs. Besides, we
find that existing evaluation methods might be affected by the input
instructions and generation styles of LVLMs. Thus, we further design an
improved evaluation method for object hallucination by proposing a
polling-based query method called POPE. Experiment results demonstrate that our
POPE can evaluate the object hallucination in a more stable and flexible way.

issue becomes even more pronounced in low-resource settings, such as
cross-lingual transfer. With the existing faithful metrics focusing on English,
even measuring the extent of this phenomenon in cross-lingual settings is hard.
To address this, we first develop a novel metric, mFACT, evaluating the

weighs the loss of each training example by its faithfulness score. Through

DocumentNet consists of 30M documents spanning nearly 400 document types
organized in a four-level ontology. Experiments on a set of broadly adopted
VDER tasks show significant improvements when DocumentNet is incorporated into
the pre-training for both classic and few-shot learning settings. With the
recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), DocumentNet provides a large

<span><p>The recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), have led to a new
trend of applying large language models (LLMs) to real-world scenarios. While
the latest LLMs are astonishingly fluent when interacting with humans, they
suffer from the misinformation problem by unintentionally generating factually
false statements. This can lead to harmful consequences, especially when
produced within sensitive contexts, such as healthcare. Yet few previous works
have focused on evaluating misinformation in the long-form (LF) generation of
LLMs, especially for knowledge-intensive topics. Moreover, although LLMs have
been shown to perform well in different languages, misinformation evaluation
has been mostly conducted in English. To this end, we present a benchmark,
CARE-MI, for evaluating LLM misinformation in: 1) a sensitive topic,
specifically the maternity and infant care domain; and 2) a language other than
English, namely Chinese. Most importantly, we provide an innovative paradigm
for building LF generation evaluation benchmarks that can be transferred to
other knowledge-intensive domains and low-resourced languages. Our proposed
benchmark fills the gap between the extensive usage of LLMs and the lack of
datasets for assessing the misinformation generated by these models. It
contains 1,612 expert-checked questions, accompanied with human-selected
references. Using our benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments and found
that current Chinese LLMs are far from perfect in the topic of maternity and
infant care. In an effort to minimize the reliance on human resources for
performance evaluation, we offer off-the-shelf judgment models for
automatically assessing the LF output of LLMs given benchmark questions.
Moreover, we compare potential solutions for LF generation evaluation and
provide insights for building better automated metrics.

<span><p>We observe that pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are capable of
autoregressively completing complex token sequences -- from arbitrary ones
procedurally generated by probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFG), to more
rich spatial patterns found in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a
general AI benchmark, prompted in the style of ASCII art. Surprisingly, pattern
completion proficiency can be partially retained even when the sequences are
expressed using tokens randomly sampled from the vocabulary. These results
suggest that without any additional training, LLMs can serve as general
sequence modelers, driven by in-context learning. In this work, we investigate
how these zero-shot capabilities may be applied to problems in robotics -- from
extrapolating sequences of numbers that represent states over time to complete
simple motions, to least-to-most prompting of reward-conditioned trajectories
that can discover and represent closed-loop policies (e.g., a stabilizing
controller for CartPole). While difficult to deploy today for real systems due
to latency, context size limitations, and compute costs, the approach of using

introduce AlpaGasus, which is finetuned on only 9k high-quality data filtered

Alpaca as evaluated by GPT-4 on multiple test sets and the controlled human

<span><p>This paper focuses on term-status pair extraction from medical dialogues
(MD-TSPE), which is essential in diagnosis dialogue systems and the automatic
scribe of electronic medical records (EMRs). In the past few years, works on
MD-TSPE have attracted increasing research attention, especially after the
remarkable progress made by generative methods. However, these generative
methods output a whole sequence consisting of term-status pairs in one stage
and ignore integrating prior knowledge, which demands a deeper understanding to
model the relationship between terms and infer the status of each term. This
paper presents a knowledge-enhanced two-stage generative framework (KTGF) to
address the above challenges. Using task-specific prompts, we employ a single
model to complete the MD-TSPE through two phases in a unified generative form:
we generate all terms the first and then generate the status of each generated
term. In this way, the relationship between terms can be learned more
effectively from the sequence containing only terms in the first phase, and our
designed knowledge-enhanced prompt in the second phase can leverage the
category and status candidates of the generated term for status generation.
Furthermore, our proposed special status "not mentioned" makes more terms
available and enriches the training data in the second phase, which is critical
in the low-resource setting. The experiments on the Chunyu and CMDD datasets
show that the proposed method achieves superior results compared to the
state-of-the-art models in the full training and low-resource settings.

<span><p>Shannon, in his seminal paper introducing information theory, divided the
communication into three levels: technical, semantic, and effectivenss. While
the technical level is concerned with accurate reconstruction of transmitted

problem has produced great advances like the internet. Large Language Models
(LLMs) make some progress towards the second goal, but the third level still
remains largely untouched. The third problem deals with predicting and
optimizing communication for desired receiver behavior. LLMs, while showing
wide generalization capabilities across a wide range of tasks, are unable to
solve for this. One reason for the underperformance could be a lack of
``behavior tokens'' in LLMs' training corpora. Behavior tokens define receiver
behavior over a communication, such as shares, likes, clicks, purchases,
retweets, etc. While preprocessing data for LLM training, behavior tokens are
often removed from the corpora as noise. Therefore, in this paper, we make some
initial progress towards reintroducing behavior tokens in LLM training. The
trained models, other than showing similar performance to LLMs on content
understanding tasks, show generalization capabilities on behavior simulation,
content simulation, behavior understanding, and behavior domain adaptation.
Using a wide range of tasks on two corpora, we show results on all these
capabilities. We call these models Large Content and Behavior Models (LCBMs).
Further, to spur more research on LCBMs, we release our new Content Behavior

use of the \textit{ReLU} activation function could potentially introduce a bias
