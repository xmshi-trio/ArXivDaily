<summary class="article-expander__title">Prompt Risk Control: A Rigorous Framework for Responsible Deployment of Large Language Models. (arXiv:2311.13628v1 [cs.LG])</summary>
<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13628">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>The recent explosion in the capabilities of large language models has led to
a wave of interest in how best to prompt a model to perform a given task. While
it may be tempting to simply choose a prompt based on average performance on a
validation set, this can lead to a deployment where unexpectedly poor responses
are generated, especially for the worst-off users. To mitigate this prospect,
we propose Prompt Risk Control, a lightweight framework for selecting a prompt
based on rigorous upper bounds on families of informative risk measures. We
offer methods for producing bounds on a diverse set of metrics, including
quantities that measure worst-case responses and disparities in generation
quality across the population of users. In addition, we extend the underlying
statistical bounding techniques to accommodate the possibility of distribution
shifts in deployment. Experiments on applications such as open-ended chat,
medical question summarization, and code generation highlight how such a
framework can foster responsible deployment by reducing the risk of the worst
outcomes.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13647">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Language models produce a distribution over the next token; can we use this
information to recover the prompt tokens? We consider the problem of language
model inversion and show that next-token probabilities contain a surprising
amount of information about the preceding text. Often we can recover the text
in cases where it is hidden from the user, motivating a method for recovering
unknown prompts given only the model's current distribution output. We consider
a variety of model access scenarios, and show how even without predictions for
every token in the vocabulary we can recover the probability vector through
search. On Llama-2 7b, our inversion method reconstructs prompts with a BLEU of
$59$ and token-level F1 of $78$ and recovers $27\%$ of prompts exactly. Code

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13657">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>As pretrained transformer language models continue to achieve
state-of-the-art performance, the Natural Language Processing community has
pushed for advances in model compression and efficient attention mechanisms to
address high computational requirements and limited input sequence length.
Despite these separate efforts, no investigation has been done into the
intersection of these two fields. In this work, we provide an evaluation of
model compression via knowledge distillation on efficient attention
transformers. We provide cost-performance trade-offs for the compression of
state-of-the-art efficient attention architectures and the gains made in
performance in comparison to their full attention counterparts. Furthermore, we
introduce a new long-context Named Entity Recognition dataset, GONERD, to train
and test the performance of NER models on long sequences. We find that
distilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of
original model performance, preserving up to 98.6% across short-context tasks
(GLUE, SQUAD, CoNLL-2003), up to 94.6% across long-context
Question-and-Answering tasks (HotpotQA, TriviaQA), and up to 98.8% on
long-context Named Entity Recognition (GONERD), while decreasing inference
times by up to 57.8%. We find that, for most models on most tasks, performing
knowledge distillation is an effective method to yield high-performing
efficient attention models with low costs.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13668">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>We present a radiology-specific multimodal model for the task for generating
radiological reports from chest X-rays (CXRs). Our work builds on the idea that
large language model(s) can be equipped with multimodal capabilities through
alignment with pre-trained vision encoders. On natural images, this has been
shown to allow multimodal models to gain image understanding and description
capabilities. Our proposed model (MAIRA-1) leverages a CXR-specific image
encoder in conjunction with a fine-tuned large language model based on
Vicuna-7B, and text-based data augmentation, to produce reports with
state-of-the-art quality. In particular, MAIRA-1 significantly improves on the
radiologist-aligned RadCliQ metric and across all lexical metrics considered.
Manual review of model outputs demonstrates promising fluency and accuracy of
generated reports while uncovering failure modes not captured by existing
evaluation practices. More information and resources can be found on the

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13708">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>To address the challenge of identifying and understanding hidden dangers in
substations from unstructured text data, a novel dynamic analysis method is
proposed. This approach begins by analyzing and extracting data from the
unstructured text related to hidden dangers. It then leverages a flexible,
distributed data search engine built on Elastic-Search to handle this
information. Following this, the hidden Markov model is employed to train the
data within the engine. The Viterbi algorithm is integrated to decipher the
hidden state sequences, facilitating the segmentation and labeling of entities
related to hidden dangers. The final step involves using the Neo4j graph
database to dynamically create a knowledge map that visualizes hidden dangers
in the substation. This method's effectiveness is demonstrated through an
example analysis using data from a specific substation's hidden dangers.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13729">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>End-to-end relation extraction (E2ERE) is an important and realistic
application of natural language processing (NLP) in biomedicine. In this paper,
we aim to compare three prevailing paradigms for E2ERE using a complex dataset
focused on rare diseases involving discontinuous and nested entities. We use
the RareDis information extraction dataset to evaluate three competing
approaches (for E2ERE): NER $\rightarrow$ RE pipelines, joint sequence to
sequence models, and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models. We use
comparable state-of-the-art models and best practices for each of these
approaches and conduct error analyses to assess their failure modes. Our
findings reveal that pipeline models are still the best, while
sequence-to-sequence models are not far behind; GPT models with eight times as
many parameters are worse than even sequence-to-sequence models and lose to
pipeline models by over 10 F1 points. Partial matches and discontinuous
entities caused many NER errors contributing to lower overall E2E performances.
We also verify these findings on a second E2ERE dataset for chemical-protein
interactions. Although generative LM-based methods are more suitable for
zero-shot settings, when training data is available, our results show that it
is better to work with more conventional models trained and tailored for E2ERE.
More innovative methods are needed to marry the best of the both worlds from
smaller encoder-decoder pipeline models and the larger GPT models to improve
E2ERE. As of now, we see that well designed pipeline models offer substantial
performance gains at a lower cost and carbon footprint for E2ERE. Our
contribution is also the first to conduct E2ERE for the RareDis dataset.

<span><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) show potential for clinical
applications, such as clinical decision support and trial recommendations.
However, the GPT-4 LLM predicts an excessive number of ICD codes for medical
coding tasks, leading to high recall but low precision. To tackle this
challenge, we introduce LLM-codex, a two-stage approach to predict ICD codes
that first generates evidence proposals using an LLM and then employs an
LSTM-based verification stage. The LSTM learns from both the LLM's high recall

the only approach that simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art results in
medical coding accuracy, accuracy on rare codes, and sentence-level evidence
identification to support coding decisions without training on human-annotated

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Understanding the semantics of relational tables is instrumental for
automation in data exploration and preparation systems. A key source for
understanding a table is the semantics of its columns. With the rise of deep
learning, learned table representations are now available, which can be applied
for semantic type detection and achieve good performance on benchmarks.
Nevertheless, we observe a gap between this performance and its applicability
in practice. In this paper, we propose AdaTyper to address one of the most
critical deployment challenges: adaptation. AdaTyper uses weak-supervision to
adapt a hybrid type predictor towards new semantic types and shifted data
distributions at inference time, using minimal human feedback. The hybrid type
predictor of AdaTyper combines rule-based methods and a light machine learning
model for semantic column type detection. We evaluate the adaptation
performance of AdaTyper on real-world database tables hand-annotated with
semantic column types through crowdsourcing and find that the f1-score improves
for new and existing types. AdaTyper approaches an average precision of 0.6
after only seeing 5 examples, significantly outperforming existing adaptation
methods based on human-provided regular expressions or dictionaries.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13833">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Diffusion models have revolutionized generative content creation and
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models in particular have increased the creative
freedom of users by allowing scene synthesis using natural language. T2I models
excel at synthesizing concepts such as nouns, appearances, and styles. To
enable customized content creation based on a few example images of a concept,
methods such as Textual Inversion and DreamBooth invert the desired concept and
enable synthesizing it in new scenes. However, inverting more general concepts
that go beyond object appearance and style (adjectives and verbs) through
natural language, remains a challenge. Two key characteristics of these
concepts contribute to the limitations of current inversion methods. 1)
Adjectives and verbs are entangled with nouns (subject) and can hinder
appearance-based inversion methods, where the subject appearance leaks into the
concept embedding and 2) describing such concepts often extends beyond single
word embeddings (being frozen in ice, walking on a tightrope, etc.) that
current methods do not handle.
</p>
<p>In this study, we introduce Lego, a textual inversion method designed to
invert subject entangled concepts from a few example images. Lego disentangles
concepts from their associated subjects using a simple yet effective Subject
Separation step and employs a Context Loss that guides the inversion of
single/multi-embedding concepts. In a thorough user study, Lego-generated
concepts were preferred over 70% of the time when compared to the baseline.
Additionally, visual question answering using a large language model suggested
Lego-generated concepts are better aligned with the text description of the

accuracy of data annotation and diversity of potential annotations. To this
end, we propose MainGEC, which designs token-level and sentence-level training
weights based on inherent discrepancies in accuracy and potential diversity of
data annotation, respectively, and then conducts mixed-grained weighted
training to improve the training effect for GEC. Empirical evaluation shows
that whether in the Seq2Seq or Seq2Edit manner, MainGEC achieves consistent and

the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed significant
advancements in recent years, large language models (LLMs) capable of

incorrect retrieval may mislead the reasoning; 2) Limited sight. Lacking the
ability to look backward or forward, a local error in one step will propagate
along the chain.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel approach: Probabilistic Tree-of-thought
Reasoning (ProbTree). First, LLMs translate a complex question into a query
tree, in which each non-root node denotes a sub-question of its parent node.
Then, probabilistic reasoning is conducted over the tree, by solving questions
from leaf to root considering the confidence of both question decomposing and
answering. During reasoning, for leaf nodes, LLMs choose a more confident
answer from Closed-book QA that employs parametric knowledge and Open-book QA
that employs retrieved external knowledge, thus eliminating the negative
retrieval problem. For non-leaf nodes, with the hierarchical structure, LLMs
have broader sights and are able to globally reason with the information from
child nodes, thus recovering from local errors. The experiments on three
Complex QA datasets under the open-domain setting show that our approach
outperforms SOTA methods significantly, demonstrating the effect of
probabilistic tree-of-thought reasoning.

<span><p>Current automatic lyrics transcription (ALT) benchmarks focus exclusively on
word content and ignore the finer nuances of written lyrics including
formatting and punctuation, which leads to a potential misalignment with the
creative products of musicians and songwriters as well as listeners'
experiences. For example, line breaks are important in conveying information
about rhythm, emotional emphasis, rhyme, and high-level structure. To address
this issue, we introduce Jam-ALT, a new lyrics transcription benchmark based on
the JamendoLyrics dataset. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, a complete
revision of the transcripts, geared specifically towards ALT evaluation by
following a newly created annotation guide that unifies the music industry's
guidelines, covering aspects such as punctuation, line breaks, spelling,
background vocals, and non-word sounds. Secondly, a suite of evaluation metrics
designed, unlike the traditional word error rate, to capture such phenomena. We
hope that the proposed benchmark contributes to the ALT task, enabling more
precise and reliable assessments of transcription systems and enhancing the

<span><p>Learning from human feedback (LHF) -- and in particular learning from

large language models (LLMs), and has been the subject of much research. Most
recent works frame it as a reinforcement learning problem, where a reward
function is learned from pairwise preference data and the LLM is treated as a
policy which is adapted to maximize the rewards, often under additional
regularization constraints. We propose an alternative interpretation which
centers on the generative process for pairwise preferences and treats LHF as a

showing that for a family of generative processes defined via preference
behavior distribution equations, training a reward function on pairwise
preferences effectively models an annotator's implicit preference distribution.
Finally, we discuss and present findings on "annotator misspecification" --
failure cases where wrong modeling assumptions are made about annotator

<span><p>Temporal information extraction (TIE) has attracted a great deal of interest
over the last two decades, leading to the development of a significant number
of datasets. Despite its benefits, having access to a large volume of corpora
makes it difficult when it comes to benchmark TIE systems. On the one hand,
different datasets have different annotation schemes, thus hindering the
comparison between competitors across different corpora. On the other hand, the
fact that each corpus is commonly disseminated in a different format requires a
considerable engineering effort for a researcher/practitioner to develop
parsers for all of them. This constraint forces researchers to select a limited
amount of datasets to evaluate their systems which consequently limits the
comparability of the systems. Yet another obstacle that hinders the
comparability of the TIE systems is the evaluation metric employed. While most
research works adopt traditional metrics such as precision, recall, and $F_1$,
a few others prefer temporal awareness -- a metric tailored to be more
comprehensive on the evaluation of temporal systems. Although the reason for
the absence of temporal awareness in the evaluation of most systems is not
clear, one of the factors that certainly weights this decision is the necessity
to implement the temporal closure algorithm in order to compute temporal
awareness, which is not straightforward to implement neither is currently
easily available. All in all, these problems have limited the fair comparison
between approaches and consequently, the development of temporal extraction
systems. To mitigate these problems, we have developed tieval, a Python library

governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop
capable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major
approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding
and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language
models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs)
have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora,
showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers
have found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further
study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size.
Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged
language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also
show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language
models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research
community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of

method for SER. Specifically, we first construct an effective emotion CLAP
(Emo-CLAP) for SER, using pre-trained text and audio encoders. Second, given
the significance of gender information in SER, two novel multi-task learning
based GEmo-CLAP (ML-GEmo-CLAP) and soft label based GEmo-CLAP (SL-GEmo-CLAP)
models are further proposed to incorporate gender information of speech
signals, forming more reasonable objectives. Experiments on IEMOCAP indicate
that our proposed two GEmo-CLAPs consistently outperform Emo-CLAP with
different pre-trained models. Remarkably, the proposed WavLM-based SL-GEmo-CLAP
obtains the best UAR of 81.43\% and WAR of 83.16\%, which performs better than
state-of-the-art SER methods.

<span><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in
various tasks, they often struggle with hallucination problems, especially in
scenarios requiring deep and responsible reasoning. These issues could be
partially addressed by introducing external knowledge graphs (KG) in LLM
reasoning. In this paper, we propose a new LLM-KG integrating paradigm
``$\hbox{LLM}\otimes\hbox{KG}$'' which treats the LLM as an agent to
interactively explore related entities and relations on KGs and perform
reasoning based on the retrieved knowledge. We further implement this paradigm
by introducing a new approach called Think-on-Graph (ToG), in which the LLM
agent iteratively executes beam search on KG, discovers the most promising
reasoning paths, and returns the most likely reasoning results. We use a number
of well-designed experiments to examine and illustrate the following advantages
of ToG: 1) compared with LLMs, ToG has better deep reasoning power; 2) ToG has
the ability of knowledge traceability and knowledge correctability by
leveraging LLMs reasoning and expert feedback; 3) ToG provides a flexible
plug-and-play framework for different LLMs, KGs and prompting strategies
without any additional training cost; 4) the performance of ToG with small LLM
models could exceed large LLM such as GPT-4 in certain scenarios and this
reduces the cost of LLM deployment and application. As a training-free method
with lower computational cost and better generality, ToG achieves overall SOTA
in 6 out of 9 datasets where most previous SOTAs rely on additional training.

capabilities in large language models (LLMs) beyond those offered by paradigms

advantage of GoT is the ability to model the information generated by an LLM as
an arbitrary graph, where units of information ("LLM thoughts") are vertices,
and edges correspond to dependencies between these vertices. This approach
enables combining arbitrary LLM thoughts into synergistic outcomes, distilling
the essence of whole networks of thoughts, or enhancing thoughts using feedback
loops. We illustrate that GoT offers advantages over state of the art on
different tasks, for example increasing the quality of sorting by 62% over ToT,
while simultaneously reducing costs by &gt;31%. We ensure that GoT is extensible
with new thought transformations and thus can be used to spearhead new

<span><p>Objective: Clinical deep phenotyping and phenotype annotation play a critical
role in both the diagnosis of patients with rare disorders as well as in
building computationally-tractable knowledge in the rare disorders field. These
processes rely on using ontology concepts, often from the Human Phenotype
Ontology, in conjunction with a phenotype concept recognition task (supported
usually by machine learning methods) to curate patient profiles or existing
scientific literature. With the significant shift in the use of large language
models (LLMs) for most NLP tasks, we examine the performance of the latest
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models underpinning ChatGPT as a
foundation for the tasks of clinical phenotyping and phenotype annotation.
Materials and Methods: The experimental setup of the study included seven
prompts of various levels of specificity, two GPT models (gpt-3.5-turbo and
gpt-4.0) and two established gold standard corpora for phenotype recognition,
one consisting of publication abstracts and the other clinical observations.
Results: Our results show that, with an appropriate setup, these models can
achieve state of the art performance. The best run, using few-shot learning,
achieved 0.58 macro F1 score on publication abstracts and 0.75 macro F1 score
on clinical observations, the former being comparable with the state of the
art, while the latter surpassing the current best in class tool. Conclusion:
While the results are promising, the non-deterministic nature of the outcomes,
the high cost and the lack of concordance between different runs using the same

PEFT remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a pilot study
revealing that PEFT exhibits unique vulnerability to trojan attacks.
Specifically, we present PETA, a novel attack that accounts for downstream
adaptation through bilevel optimization: the upper-level objective embeds the
backdoor into a PLM while the lower-level objective simulates PEFT to retain
the PLM's task-specific performance. With extensive evaluation across a variety
of downstream tasks and trigger designs, we demonstrate PETA's effectiveness in
terms of both attack success rate and unaffected clean accuracy, even after the
victim user performs PEFT over the backdoored PLM using untainted data.
Moreover, we empirically provide possible explanations for PETA's efficacy: the
bilevel optimization inherently 'orthogonalizes' the backdoor and PEFT modules,
thereby retaining the backdoor throughout PEFT. Based on this insight, we
explore a simple defense that omits PEFT in selected layers of the backdoored
PLM and unfreezes a subset of these layers' parameters, which is shown to

approach leverages the fact that when there is no data contamination, all
orderings of an exchangeable benchmark should be equally likely. In contrast,
the tendency for language models to memorize example order means that a
contaminated language model will find certain canonical orderings to be much
more likely than others. Our test flags potential contamination whenever the
likelihood of a canonically ordered benchmark dataset is significantly higher
than the likelihood after shuffling the examples. We demonstrate that our
procedure is sensitive enough to reliably prove test set contamination in

small test sets of only 1000 examples, and datasets that appear only a few

user-defined tasks, input data, and requirements (e.g., accuracy, speed),
optimizing them comprehensively from both data and model perspectives to obtain
satisfactory models, and finally deploy these models as online service.
Experimental evaluations on classical discriminative and generative tasks in
computer vision and natural language processing domains demonstrate that our
system consistently produces models that meet the desired criteria.
Furthermore, the system exhibits the ability to critically identify and reject
unattainable tasks, such as fantastical scenarios or unethical requests,
ensuring robustness and safety. This research presents a significant
advancement in achieving desired models with increased efficiency and quality
as compared to traditional model development, facilitated by the integration of
LLM-powered analysis, decision-making, and execution capabilities, as well as
the collaboration among four agents. We anticipate that our work will
contribute to the advancement of research on TrainerAgent in both academic and
industry communities, potentially establishing it as a new paradigm for model
development in the field of AI.

<span><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have drawn extensive attention from
academia and the public, due to the advent of the ChatGPT. While LLMs show
their astonishing ability in text generation for various tasks, privacy
concerns limit their usage in real-life businesses. More specifically, either
the user's inputs (the user sends the query to the model-hosting server) or the
model (the user downloads the complete model) itself will be revealed during
the usage. Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a promising solution to this
kind of problem. It protects both the user's input and the knowledge of the
model by splitting the model into a bottom part and a top part, which is
maintained by the user and the model provider, respectively. However, in this
paper, we demonstrate that in LLMs, VFL fails to protect the user input since
it is simple and cheap to reconstruct the input from the intermediate
embeddings. Experiments show that even with a commercial GPU, the input
sentence can be reconstructed in only one second. We also discuss several
possible solutions to enhance the privacy of vertical federated LLMs.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09433">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>To ensure AI safety, instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) are
specifically trained to ensure alignment, which refers to making models behave
in accordance with human intentions. While these models have demonstrated
commendable results on various safety benchmarks, the vulnerability of their
safety alignment has not been extensively studied. This is particularly
troubling given the potential harm that LLMs can inflict. Existing attack
methods on LLMs often rely on poisoned training data or the injection of
malicious prompts. These approaches compromise the stealthiness and
generalizability of the attacks, making them susceptible to detection.
Additionally, these models often demand substantial computational resources for
implementation, making them less practical for real-world applications.
Inspired by recent success in modifying model behavior through steering vectors
without the need for optimization, and drawing on its effectiveness in
red-teaming LLMs, we conducted experiments employing activation steering to
target four key aspects of LLMs: truthfulness, toxicity, bias, and harmfulness
- across a varied set of attack settings. To establish a universal attack
strategy applicable to diverse target alignments without depending on manual
analysis, we automatically select the intervention layer based on contrastive
layer search. Our experiment results show that activation attacks are highly
effective and add little or no overhead to attack efficiency. Additionally, we
discuss potential countermeasures against such activation attacks. Our code and
data are available at https://github.com/wang2226/Backdoor-Activation-Attack

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>This work presents an analysis of the effectiveness of using standard shallow
feed-forward networks to mimic the behavior of the attention mechanism in the
original Transformer model, a state-of-the-art architecture for
sequence-to-sequence tasks. We substitute key elements of the attention
mechanism in the Transformer with simple feed-forward networks, trained using
the original components via knowledge distillation. Our experiments, conducted
on the IWSLT2017 dataset, reveal the capacity of these "attentionless
Transformers" to rival the performance of the original architecture. Through
rigorous ablation studies, and experimenting with various replacement network
types and sizes, we offer insights that support the viability of our approach.
This not only sheds light on the adaptability of shallow feed-forward networks
in emulating attention mechanisms but also underscores their potential to
streamline complex architectures for sequence-to-sequence tasks.

<span><p>From ancient water wheels to robotic process automation (RPA), automation
technology has evolved throughout history to liberate human beings from arduous
tasks. Yet, RPA struggles with tasks needing human-like intelligence,
especially in elaborate design of workflow construction and dynamic

emerged human-like intelligence, this paper introduces Agentic Process
Automation (APA), a groundbreaking automation paradigm using LLM-based agents
for advanced automation by offloading the human labor to agents associated with
construction and execution. We then instantiate ProAgent, an LLM-based agent
designed to craft workflows from human instructions and make intricate
decisions by coordinating specialized agents. Empirical experiments are
conducted to detail its construction and execution procedure of workflow,
showcasing the feasibility of APA, unveiling the possibility of a new paradigm

<span><p>Generating high-quality summaries for chat dialogs often requires large
labeled datasets. We propose a method to efficiently use unlabeled data for
extractive summarization of customer-agent dialogs. In our method, we frame
summarization as a question-answering problem and use state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) to generate pseudo-labels for a dialog. We then use
these pseudo-labels to fine-tune a chat summarization model, effectively
transferring knowledge from the large LLM into a smaller specialized model. We
demonstrate our method on the \tweetsumm dataset, and show that using 10% of
the original labelled data set we can achieve 65.9/57.0/61.0 ROUGE-1/-2/-L,
whereas the current state-of-the-art trained on the entire training data set
obtains 65.16/55.81/64.37 ROUGE-1/-2/-L. In other words, in the worst case
(i.e., ROUGE-L) we still effectively retain 94.7% of the performance while

<span><p>Soft random sampling (SRS) is a simple yet effective approach for efficient
training of large-scale deep neural networks when dealing with massive data.
SRS selects a subset uniformly at random with replacement from the full data
set in each epoch. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical and empirical
analysis of SRS. First, we analyze its sampling dynamics including data
coverage and occupancy. Next, we investigate its convergence with non-convex
objective functions and give the convergence rate. Finally, we provide its
generalization performance. We empirically evaluate SRS for image recognition
on CIFAR10 and automatic speech recognition on Librispeech and an in-house
payload dataset to demonstrate its effectiveness. Compared to existing
coreset-based data selection methods, SRS offers a better accuracy-efficiency
trade-off. Especially on real-world industrial scale data sets, it is shown to
be a powerful training strategy with significant speedup and competitive
performance with almost no additional computing cost.

<summary class="article-expander__title">White-Box Transformers via Sparse Rate Reduction: Compression Is All There Is?. (arXiv:2311.13110v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</summary>
<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13110">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>In this paper, we contend that a natural objective of representation learning
is to compress and transform the distribution of the data, say sets of tokens,
towards a low-dimensional Gaussian mixture supported on incoherent subspaces.
The goodness of such a representation can be evaluated by a principled measure,
called sparse rate reduction, that simultaneously maximizes the intrinsic
information gain and extrinsic sparsity of the learned representation. From
this perspective, popular deep network architectures, including transformers,
can be viewed as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this measure.
Particularly, we derive a transformer block from alternating optimization on
parts of this objective: the multi-head self-attention operator compresses the
representation by implementing an approximate gradient descent step on the
coding rate of the features, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron
sparsifies the features. This leads to a family of white-box transformer-like
deep network architectures, named CRATE, which are mathematically fully
interpretable. We show, by way of a novel connection between denoising and
compression, that the inverse to the aforementioned compressive encoding can be
realized by the same class of CRATE architectures. Thus, the so-derived
white-box architectures are universal to both encoders and decoders.
Experiments show that these networks, despite their simplicity, indeed learn to
compress and sparsify representations of large-scale real-world image and text
datasets, and achieve performance very close to highly engineered
transformer-based models: ViT, MAE, DINO, BERT, and GPT2. We believe the
proposed computational framework demonstrates great potential in bridging the
gap between theory and practice of deep learning, from a unified perspective of
data compression. Code is available at: https://ma-lab-berkeley.github.io/CRATE .
