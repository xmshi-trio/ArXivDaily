<span><p>This article focuses on bibliographic references generated by the ChatGPT3.5
tool. Using this tool based on the trained GPT generation model ChatGPT3.5,
developed by the company OpenAI, we explored six different themes and analyzed
a sample of references generated by the model, in French and English. The
results revealed high percentages of fictitious references in several fields,
underlining the importance of carefully checking these references before using
them in research work. An improvement in results was nevertheless noted between
May and July with regard to English references for themes on which ChatGPR3.5
has been particularly trained, but the situation remains unsatisfactory in
French, for example. It should also be pointed out that much of the text in
this article was generated by ChatGPT in a joint effort with the human author.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00804">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Problem gambling is a major public health concern and is associated with
profound psychological distress and economic problems. There are numerous
gambling communities on the internet where users exchange information about
games, gambling tactics, as well as gambling-related problems. Individuals
exhibiting higher levels of problem gambling engage more in such communities.
Online gambling communities may provide insights into problem-gambling
behaviour. Using data scraped from a major German gambling discussion board, we
fine-tuned a large language model, specifically a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, to predict signs of
problem-gambling from forum posts. Training data were generated by manual
annotation and by taking into account diagnostic criteria and gambling-related
cognitive distortions. Using k-fold cross-validation, our models achieved a
precision of 0.95 and F1 score of 0.71, demonstrating that satisfactory
classification performance can be achieved by generating high-quality training
material through manual annotation based on diagnostic criteria. The current
study confirms that a BERT-based model can be reliably used on small data sets
and to detect signatures of problem gambling in online communication data. Such
computational approaches may have potential for the detection of changes in
problem-gambling prevalence among online users.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00805">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>An increasing number of studies use gender information to understand
phenomena such as gender bias, inequity in access and participation, or the
impact of the Covid pandemic response. Unfortunately, most datasets do not
include self-reported gender information, making it necessary for researchers
to infer gender from other information, such as names or names and country
information. An important limitation of these tools is that they fail to
appropriately capture the fact that gender exists on a non-binary scale,
however, it remains important to evaluate and compare how well these tools
perform in a variety of contexts. In this paper, we compare the performance of
a generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT with three commercially
available list-based and machine learning-based gender inference tools (Namsor,
Gender-API, and genderize.io) on a unique dataset. Specifically, we use a large
Olympic athlete dataset and report how variations in the input (e.g., first
name and first and last name, with and without country information) impact the
accuracy of their predictions. We report results for the full set, as well as
for the subsets: medal versus non-medal winners, athletes from the largest
English-speaking countries, and athletes from East Asia. On these sets, we find
that Namsor is the best traditional commercially available tool. However,
ChatGPT performs at least as well as Namsor and often outperforms it,
especially for the female sample when country and/or last name information is
available. All tools perform better on medalists versus non-medalists and on
names from English-speaking countries. Although not designed for this purpose,
ChatGPT may be a cost-effective tool for gender prediction. In the future, it
might even be possible for ChatGPT or other large scale language models to
better identify self-reported gender rather than report gender on a binary
scale.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Travel behavior prediction is a fundamental task in transportation demand
management. The conventional methods for travel behavior prediction rely on
numerical data to construct mathematical models and calibrate model parameters
to represent human preferences. Recent advancement in large language models
(LLMs) has shown great reasoning abilities to solve complex problems. In this
study, we propose to use LLMs to predict travel behavior with prompt
engineering without data-based parameter learning. Specifically, we carefully
design our prompts that include 1) task description, 2) travel characteristics,
3) individual attributes, and 4) guides of thinking with domain knowledge, and
ask the LLMs to predict an individual's travel behavior and explain the
results. We select the travel mode choice task as a case study. Results show
that, though no training samples are provided, LLM-based predictions have
competitive accuracy and F1-score as canonical supervised learning methods such
as multinomial logit, random forest, and neural networks. LLMs can also output
reasons that support their prediction. However, though in most of the cases,
the output explanations are reasonable, we still observe cases that violate

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated
impressive capabilities in multimodal understanding, reasoning, and
interaction. However, existing MLLMs prevalently suffer from serious
hallucination problems, generating text that is not factually grounded in
associated images. The problem makes existing MLLMs untrustworthy and thus
impractical in real-world (especially high-stakes) applications. To address the
challenge, we present RLHF-V, which enhances MLLM trustworthiness via behavior
alignment from fine-grained correctional human feedback. Specifically, RLHF-V
collects human preference in the form of segment-level corrections on
hallucinations, and performs dense direct preference optimization over the
human feedback. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks in both automatic
and human evaluation show that, RLHF-V can enable substantially more
trustworthy MLLM behaviors with promising data and computation efficiency.
Remarkably, using 1.4k annotated data samples, RLHF-V significantly reduces the
hallucination rate of the base MLLM by 34.8%, outperforming the concurrent
LLaVA-RLHF trained on 10k annotated data. The final model achieves
state-of-the-art performance in trustworthiness among open-source MLLMs, and
shows better robustness than GPT-4V in preventing hallucinations aroused from
over-generalization. We open-source our code, model, and data at

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>The knowledge graph is a structure to store and represent knowledge, and
recent studies have discussed its capability to assist language models for
various applications. Some variations of knowledge graphs aim to record
arguments and their relations for computational argumentation tasks. However,
many must simplify semantic types to fit specific schemas, thus losing
flexibility and expression ability. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical
Argumentation Graph (Hi-ArG), a new structure to organize arguments. We also
introduce two approaches to exploit Hi-ArG, including a text-graph multi-modal
model GreaseArG and a new pre-training framework augmented with graph
information. Experiments on two argumentation tasks have shown that after
further pre-training and fine-tuning, GreaseArG supersedes same-scale language
models on these tasks, while incorporating graph information during further

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>The field of unsupervised machine translation has seen significant
advancement from the marriage of the Transformer and the back-translation
algorithm. The Transformer is a powerful generative model, and back-translation
leverages Transformer's high-quality translations for iterative
self-improvement. However, the Transformer is encumbered by the run-time of
autoregressive inference during back-translation, and back-translation is
limited by a lack of synthetic data efficiency. We propose a two-for-one
improvement to Transformer back-translation: Quick Back-Translation (QBT). QBT
re-purposes the encoder as a generative model, and uses encoder-generated
sequences to train the decoder in conjunction with the original autoregressive
back-translation step, improving data throughput and utilization. Experiments
on various WMT benchmarks demonstrate that a relatively small number of
refining steps of QBT improve current unsupervised machine translation models,
and that QBT dramatically outperforms standard back-translation only method in
terms of training efficiency for comparable translation qualities.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>The fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to recently
achieve milestones in natural language processing applications. The emergence
of ever larger LLMs has paved the way for more efficient fine-tuning methods.
Among these, the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method keeps most of the weights of
the pre-trained LLM frozen while introducing a low-rank decomposition of the
weight matrix, enabling the tuning of only a very small proportion of the
network. The performance on downstream tasks of models fine-tuned with LoRA
heavily relies on a set of hyperparameters including the rank of the
decomposition. In this work, we investigate the choice of these hyperparameters
through two main blackbox optimization (BBO) techniques. We examine the whole
pipeline of performing fine-tuning and validation on a pre-trained LLM as a
blackbox and efficiently explore the space of hyperparameters with the \nomad

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Compressing large language models (LLMs), often consisting of billions of
parameters, provides faster inference, smaller memory footprints, and enables
local deployment. Two standard compression techniques are pruning and
quantization, with the former eliminating redundant connections in model layers
and the latter representing model parameters with fewer bits. The key tradeoff
is between the degree of compression and the impact on the quality of the
compressed model. Existing research on LLM compression primarily focuses on
performance in terms of general metrics like perplexity or downstream task
accuracy. More fine-grained metrics, such as those measuring parametric
knowledge, remain significantly underexplored. To help bridge this gap, we
present a comprehensive analysis across multiple model families (ENCODER,
ENCODER-DECODER, and DECODER) using the LAMA and LM-HARNESS benchmarks in order
to systematically quantify the effect of commonly employed compression
techniques on model performance. A particular focus is on tradeoffs involving
parametric knowledge, with the goal of providing practitioners with practical

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Large multi-modal models (LMMs) exhibit remarkable performance across
numerous tasks. However, generalist LMMs often suffer from performance
degradation when tuned over a large collection of tasks. Recent research
suggests that Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures are useful for instruction
tuning, but for LMMs of parameter size around O(50-100B), the prohibitive cost
of replicating and storing the expert models severely limits the number of
experts we can use. We propose Omni-SMoLA, an architecture that uses the Soft
MoE approach to (softly) mix many multimodal low rank experts, and avoids
introducing a significant number of new parameters compared to conventional MoE
models. The core intuition here is that the large model provides a foundational
backbone, while different lightweight experts residually learn specialized
knowledge, either per-modality or multimodally. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the SMoLA approach helps improve the generalist performance
across a broad range of generative vision-and-language tasks, achieving new
SoTA generalist performance that often matches or outperforms single
specialized LMM baselines, as well as new SoTA specialist performance.

<span><p>Multi-domain fake news detection aims to identify whether various news from
different domains is real or fake and has become urgent and important. However,
existing methods are dedicated to improving the overall performance of fake
news detection, ignoring the fact that unbalanced data leads to disparate
treatment for different domains, i.e., the domain bias problem. To solve this
problem, we propose the Dual-Teacher De-biasing Distillation framework (DTDBD)
to mitigate bias across different domains. Following the knowledge distillation
methods, DTDBD adopts a teacher-student structure, where pre-trained large
teachers instruct a student model. In particular, the DTDBD consists of an
unbiased teacher and a clean teacher that jointly guide the student model in
mitigating domain bias and maintaining performance. For the unbiased teacher,
we introduce an adversarial de-biasing distillation loss to instruct the
student model in learning unbiased domain knowledge. For the clean teacher, we
design domain knowledge distillation loss, which effectively incentivizes the
student model to focus on representing domain features while maintaining
performance. Moreover, we present a momentum-based dynamic adjustment algorithm
to trade off the effects of two teachers. Extensive experiments on Chinese and

state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of bias metrics while guaranteeing

<span><p>Designing high-quality educational questions is a challenging and
time-consuming task. In this work, we propose a novel approach that utilizes
prompt-based techniques to generate descriptive and reasoning-based questions.
However, current question-answering (QA) datasets are inadequate for conducting
our experiments on prompt-based question generation (QG) in an educational
setting. Therefore, we curate a new QG dataset called EduProbe for school-level
subjects, by leveraging the rich content of NCERT textbooks. We carefully
annotate this dataset as quadruples of 1) Context: a segment upon which the
question is formed; 2) Long Prompt: a long textual cue for the question (i.e.,
a longer sequence of words or phrases, covering the main theme of the context);
3) Short Prompt: a short textual cue for the question (i.e., a condensed
representation of the key information or focus of the context); 4) Question: a
deep question that aligns with the context and is coherent with the prompts. We
investigate several prompt-based QG methods by fine-tuning pre-trained
transformer-based large language models (LLMs), namely PEGASUS, T5, MBART, and
BART. Moreover, we explore the performance of two general-purpose pre-trained
LLMs such as Text-Davinci-003 and GPT-3.5-Turbo without any further training.
By performing automatic evaluation, we show that T5 (with long prompt)
outperforms all other models, but still falls short of the human baseline.

Prior studies attempted to overcome this challenge by increasing the model size

improvement in LLMs with smaller-scale model sizes (&lt;100B). In this work, we
start from a pre-trained general LLM model (AntGLM-10B) and fine-tune it from a
medical beginner towards a medical expert (called AntGLM-Med-10B), which
leverages a 3-stage optimization procedure, \textit{i.e.}, general medical
knowledge injection, medical domain instruction tuning, and specific medical
task adaptation. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We specifically
investigate how to adapt a pre-trained general LLM in medical domain,

large-scale medical datasets for each stage of the optimization process. These
datasets encompass various data types and tasks, such as question-answering,
medical reasoning, multi-choice questions, and medical conversations. (3)
Specifically for multi-choice questions in the medical domain, we propose a
novel Verification-of-Choice approach for prompting engineering, which

Due to online education and remote work, these communities have become central

<span><p>The question of how to probe contextual word representations for linguistic
structure in a way that is both principled and useful has seen significant
attention recently in the NLP literature. In our contribution to this
discussion, we argue for a probe metric that reflects the fundamental trade-off
between probe complexity and performance: the Pareto hypervolume. To measure
complexity, we present a number of parametric and non-parametric metrics. Our
experiments using Pareto hypervolume as an evaluation metric show that probes
often do not conform to our expectations -- e.g., why should the non-contextual
fastText representations encode more morpho-syntactic information than the
contextual BERT representations? These results suggest that common, simplistic
probing tasks, such as part-of-speech labeling and dependency arc labeling, are
inadequate to evaluate the linguistic structure encoded in contextual word
representations. This leads us to propose full dependency parsing as a probing
task. In support of our suggestion that harder probing tasks are necessary, our
experiments with dependency parsing reveal a wide gap in syntactic knowledge

<span><p>Information Extraction (IE) seeks to derive structured information from
unstructured texts, often facing challenges in low-resource scenarios due to
data scarcity and unseen classes. This paper presents a review of neural
approaches to low-resource IE from \emph{traditional} and \emph{LLM-based}
perspectives, systematically categorizing them into a fine-grained taxonomy.
Then we conduct empirical study on LLM-based methods compared with previous
state-of-the-art models, and discover that (1) well-tuned LMs are still
predominant; (2) tuning open-resource LLMs and ICL with GPT family is promising
in general; (3) the optimal LLM-based technical solution for low-resource IE
can be task-dependent. In addition, we discuss low-resource IE with LLMs,
highlight promising applications, and outline potential research directions.
This survey aims to foster understanding of this field, inspire new ideas, and
encourage widespread applications in both academia and industry.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Despite widespread use of LLMs as conversational agents, evaluations of
performance fail to capture a crucial aspect of communication: interpreting
language in context -- incorporating its pragmatics. Humans interpret language
using beliefs and prior knowledge about the world. For example, we intuitively
understand the response "I wore gloves" to the question "Did you leave
fingerprints?" as meaning "No". To investigate whether LLMs have the ability to
make this type of inference, known as an implicature, we design a simple task
and evaluate four categories of widely used state-of-the-art models. We find
that, despite only evaluating on utterances that require a binary inference
(yes or no), models in three of these categories perform close to random.
However, LLMs instruction-tuned at the example-level perform significantly
better. These results suggest that certain fine-tuning strategies are far
better at inducing pragmatic understanding in models. We present our findings
as the starting point for further research into evaluating how LLMs interpret
language in context and to drive the development of more pragmatic and useful
models of human discourse.

<span><p>While large language models (LLMs) have proven to be effective on a large
variety of tasks, they are also known to hallucinate information. To measure
whether an LLM prefers factually consistent continuations of its input, we
propose a new benchmark called FIB(Factual Inconsistency Benchmark) that
focuses on the task of summarization. Specifically, our benchmark involves
comparing the scores an LLM assigns to a factually consistent versus a
factually inconsistent summary for an input news article. For factually
consistent summaries, we use human-written reference summaries that we manually
verify as factually consistent. To generate summaries that are factually
inconsistent, we generate summaries from a suite of summarization models that
we have manually annotated as factually inconsistent. A model's factual
consistency is then measured according to its accuracy, i.e.\ the proportion of
documents where it assigns a higher score to the factually consistent summary.
To validate the usefulness of FIB, we evaluate 23 large language models ranging
from 1B to 176B parameters from six different model families including BLOOM
and OPT. We find that existing LLMs generally assign a higher score to
factually consistent summaries than to factually inconsistent summaries.
However, if the factually inconsistent summaries occur verbatim in the
document, then LLMs assign a higher score to these factually inconsistent
summaries than factually consistent summaries. We validate design choices in
our benchmark including the scoring method and source of distractor summaries.

fine-tuning (SFT) with human annotations and reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) to align the output of large language models (LLMs) with human
intentions, ensuring they are helpful, ethical, and reliable. However, this
dependence can significantly constrain the true potential of AI-assistant
agents due to the high cost of obtaining human supervision and the related
issues on quality, reliability, diversity, self-consistency, and undesirable
biases. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called
SELF-ALIGN, which combines principle-driven reasoning and the generative power
of LLMs for the self-alignment of AI agents with minimal human supervision. Our
approach encompasses four stages: first, we use an LLM to generate synthetic
prompts, and a topic-guided method to augment the prompt diversity; second, we
use a small set of human-written principles for AI models to follow, and guide
the LLM through in-context learning from demonstrations (of principles
application) to produce helpful, ethical, and reliable responses to user's
queries; third, we fine-tune the original LLM with the high-quality
self-aligned responses so that the resulting model can generate desirable
responses for each query directly without the principle set and the
demonstrations anymore; and finally, we offer a refinement step to address the
issues of overly-brief or indirect responses. Applying SELF-ALIGN to the
LLaMA-65b base language model, we develop an AI assistant named Dromedary. With
fewer than 300 lines of human annotations (including &lt; 200 seed prompts, 16

Given a knowledge-intensive question, CoK first prepares several preliminary

there is no majority consensus among the answers from samples, CoK corrects the
rationales step by step by adapting knowledge from the identified domains.
These corrected rationales can plausibly serve as a better foundation for the
final answer consolidation. Unlike prior studies that primarily use
unstructured data, CoK also leverages structured knowledge sources such as

of toxicity detection. We operationalize the "margins" of a dataset by
employing outlier detection to identify text about people with demographic

as brain-like coordinators. The associated risks will be revealed as we
delegate an increasing number of tasks to machines for automated completion. A
big question emerges: how can we make machines behave responsibly when helping
humans automate tasks as personal copilots? In this paper, we explore this
question in depth from the perspectives of feasibility, completeness and
security. In specific, we present Responsible Task Automation (ResponsibleTA)
as a fundamental framework to facilitate responsible collaboration between
LLM-based coordinators and executors for task automation with three empowered
capabilities: 1) predicting the feasibility of the commands for executors; 2)
verifying the completeness of executors; 3) enhancing the security (e.g., the
protection of users' privacy). We further propose and compare two paradigms for
implementing the first two capabilities. One is to leverage the generic
knowledge of LLMs themselves via prompt engineering while the other is to adopt
domain-specific learnable models. Moreover, we introduce a local memory
mechanism for achieving the third capability. We evaluate our proposed
ResponsibleTA on UI task automation and hope it could bring more attentions to
ensuring LLMs more responsible in diverse scenarios.

<span><p>Lexicon-based sentiment analysis (SA) in finance leverages specialized,
manually annotated lexicons created by human experts to extract sentiment from
financial texts. Although lexicon-based methods are simple to implement and
fast to operate on textual data, they require considerable manual annotation
efforts to create, maintain, and update the lexicons. These methods are also
considered inferior to the deep learning-based approaches, such as transformer
models, which have become dominant in various NLP tasks due to their remarkable
performance. However, transformers require extensive data and computational
resources for both training and testing. Additionally, they involve significant
prediction times, making them unsuitable for real-time production environments
or systems with limited processing capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a
novel methodology named eXplainable Lexicons (XLex) that combines the
advantages of both lexicon-based methods and transformer models. We propose an
approach that utilizes transformers and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
for explainability to learn financial lexicons. Our study presents four main
contributions. Firstly, we demonstrate that transformer-aided explainable
lexicons can enhance the vocabulary coverage of the benchmark Loughran-McDonald
(LM) lexicon, reducing the human involvement in annotating, maintaining, and
updating the lexicons. Secondly, we show that the resulting lexicon outperforms
the standard LM lexicon in SA of financial datasets. Thirdly, we illustrate
that the lexicon-based approach is significantly more efficient in terms of
model speed and size compared to transformers. Lastly, the XLex approach is
inherently more interpretable than transformer models as lexicon models rely on
predefined rules, allowing for better insights into the results of SA and
making the XLex approach a viable tool for financial decision-making.

major concern for both consumers and businesses. Such reviews can deceive
customers and cause damage to the reputation of products or services, making it
crucial to identify them. Although the detection of fake reviews has been
extensively studied in English language, detecting fake reviews in non-English
languages such as Bengali is still a relatively unexplored research area. This
paper introduces the Bengali Fake Review Detection (BFRD) dataset, the first
publicly available dataset for identifying fake reviews in Bengali. The dataset
consists of 7710 non-fake and 1339 fake food-related reviews collected from
social media posts. To convert non-Bengali words in a review, a unique pipeline
has been proposed that translates English words to their corresponding Bengali
meaning and also back transliterates Romanized Bengali to Bengali. We have

To address this gap, we propose complexity-impacted reasoning score (CIRS),

<span><p>Labeling neural network submodules with human-legible descriptions is useful
for many downstream tasks: such descriptions can surface failures, guide
interventions, and perhaps even explain important model behaviors. To date,
most mechanistic descriptions of trained networks have involved small models,
narrowly delimited phenomena, and large amounts of human labor. Labeling all
human-interpretable sub-computations in models of increasing size and
complexity will almost certainly require tools that can generate and validate
descriptions automatically. Recently, techniques that use learned models
in-the-loop for labeling have begun to gain traction, but methods for
evaluating their efficacy are limited and ad-hoc. How should we validate and
compare open-ended labeling tools? This paper introduces FIND (Function
INterpretation and Description), a benchmark suite for evaluating the building
blocks of automated interpretability methods. FIND contains functions that
resemble components of trained neural networks, and accompanying descriptions
of the kind we seek to generate. The functions span textual and numeric
domains, and involve a range of real-world complexities. We evaluate methods
that use pretrained language models (LMs) to produce descriptions of function
behavior in natural language and code. Additionally, we introduce a new
interactive method in which an Automated Interpretability Agent (AIA) generates
function descriptions. We find that an AIA, built from an LM with black-box
access to functions, can infer function structure, acting as a scientist by
forming hypotheses, proposing experiments, and updating descriptions in light
of new data. However, AIA descriptions tend to capture global function behavior
and miss local details. These results suggest that FIND will be useful for
evaluating more sophisticated interpretability methods before they are applied
to real-world models.

multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state

<span><p>This technical report explores the ability of ChatGPT in recognizing emotions
from text, which can be the basis of various applications like interactive
chatbots, data annotation, and mental health analysis. While prior research has
shown ChatGPT's basic ability in sentiment analysis, its performance in more
nuanced emotion recognition is not yet explored. Here, we conducted experiments
to evaluate its performance of emotion recognition across different datasets
and emotion labels. Our findings indicate a reasonable level of reproducibility
in its performance, with noticeable improvement through fine-tuning. However,
the performance varies with different emotion labels and datasets, highlighting
an inherent instability and possible bias. The choice of dataset and emotion
labels significantly impacts ChatGPT's emotion recognition performance. This
paper sheds light on the importance of dataset and label selection, and the
potential of fine-tuning in enhancing ChatGPT's emotion recognition
capabilities, providing a groundwork for better integration of emotion analysis

systems such as ChatGPT, ChatGLM, ChatDoctor, DoctorGLM, and etc. However, the
limited information provided by users during single turn results in inadequate
personalization and targeting of the generated suggestions, which requires
users to independently select the useful part. It is mainly caused by the
missing ability to engage in multi-turn questioning. In real-world medical
consultations, doctors usually employ a series of iterative inquiries to
comprehend the patient's condition thoroughly, enabling them to provide
effective and personalized suggestions subsequently, which can be defined as
chain of questioning (CoQ) for LLMs. To improve the CoQ of LLMs, we propose
BianQue, a ChatGLM-based LLM finetuned with the self-constructed health

proposal, we run proof-of-concept simulations in the economic ultimatum game,
formalizing user preferences as policies that guide the actions of simulated
players. We find that the AI assistant accurately aligns its behavior to match
standard policies from the economic literature (e.g., selfish, altruistic).
However, the assistant's learned policies lack robustness and exhibit limited
generalization in an out-of-distribution setting when confronted with a
currency (e.g., grams of medicine) that was not included in the assistant's
training distribution. Additionally, we find that when there is inconsistency
in the relationship between language use and an unknown policy (e.g., an
altruistic policy combined with rude language), the assistant's learning of the

desirable for these devices to learn from user-generated conversation data to

user-generated data usually contains sensitive and private information, and
uploading such data to the cloud for annotation is not preferred if not
prohibited. While it is possible to obtain annotation locally by directly
asking users to provide preferred responses, such annotations have to be sparse
to not affect user experience. In addition, the storage of edge devices is
usually too limited to enable large-scale fine-tuning with full user-generated
data. It remains an open question how to enable on-device LLM personalization,
considering sparse annotation and limited on-device storage. In this paper, we

work shows shows that there is an inherent statistical lower-bound on the rate
that pretrained language models hallucinate certain types of facts, having
nothing to do with the transformer LM architecture or data quality. For
"arbitrary" facts whose veracity cannot be determined from the training data,
we show that hallucinations must occur at a certain rate for language models

bounded, we show that the probability of generating a hallucination is close to
the fraction of facts that occur exactly once in the training data (a
"Good-Turing" estimate), even assuming ideal training data without errors.
</p>
<p>One conclusion is that models pretrained to be sufficiently good predictors
(i.e., calibrated) may require post-training to mitigate hallucinations on the

will lead to hallucination on facts that tend to appear more than once in the

to leverage user-provided code when solving programming tasks and (2) a method
to iteratively generate modular sub-functions that can aid future code
generation attempts when the initial code generated by the LLM is inadequate.
Generating computer programs in general-purpose programming languages like
Python poses a challenge for LLMs when instructed to use code provided in the
prompt. Code-specific LLMs (e.g., GitHub Copilot, CodeLlama2) can generate code
completions in real-time by drawing on all code available in a development
environment. However, restricting code-specific LLMs to use only in-context
code is not straightforward, as the model is not explicitly instructed to use
the user-provided code and users cannot highlight precisely which snippets of
code the model should incorporate into its context. Moreover, current systems
lack effective recovery methods, forcing users to iteratively re-prompt the
model with modified prompts until a sufficient solution is reached. Our method
differs from traditional LLM-powered code-generation by constraining
code-generation to an explicit function set and enabling recovery from failed
attempts through automatically generated sub-functions. When the LLM cannot
produce working code, we generate modular sub-functions to aid subsequent
attempts at generating functional code. A by-product of our method is a library
of reusable sub-functions that can solve related tasks, imitating a software
team where efficiency scales with experience. We also introduce a new
"half-shot" evaluation paradigm that provides tighter estimates of LLMs' coding
abilities compared to traditional zero-shot evaluation. Our proposed evaluation
method encourages models to output solutions in a structured format, decreasing
syntax errors that can be mistaken for poor coding ability.

<span><p>Data augmentation via back-translation is common when pretraining
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) models, even though the generated
instructions are noisy. But: does that noise matter? We find that nonsensical
or irrelevant language instructions during pretraining can have little effect
on downstream performance for both HAMT and VLN-BERT on R2R, and is still
better than only using clean, human data. To underscore these results, we
concoct an efficient augmentation method, Unigram + Object, which generates
nonsensical instructions that nonetheless improve downstream performance. Our
findings suggest that what matters for VLN R2R pretraining is the quantity of
visual trajectories, not the quality of instructions.

<summary class="article-expander__title">AlignBench: Benchmarking Chinese Alignment of Large Language Models. (arXiv:2311.18743v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</summary>

<span><p>Alignment has become a critical step for instruction-tuned Large Language
Models (LLMs) to become helpful assistants. However, effective evaluation of
alignment for emerging Chinese LLMs is still significantly lacking, calling for
real-scenario grounded, open-ended, challenging and automatic evaluations
tailored for alignment. To fill in this gap, we introduce AlignBench, a
comprehensive multi-dimensional benchmark for evaluating LLMs' alignment in
Chinese. Equipped with a human-in-the-loop data curation pipeline, our
benchmark employs a rule-calibrated multi-dimensional LLM-as-Judge with
Chain-of-Thought to generate explanations and final ratings as evaluations,
ensuring high reliability and interpretability. Furthermore, we report
AlignBench evaluated by CritiqueLLM, a dedicated Chinese evaluator LLM that
recovers 95% of GPT-4's evaluation ability. We will provide public APIs for
evaluating AlignBench with CritiqueLLM to facilitate the evaluation of LLMs'
Chinese alignment. All evaluation codes, data, and LLM generations are
available at \url{https://github.com/THUDM/AlignBench}.

<summary class="article-expander__title">BioCLIP: A Vision Foundation Model for the Tree of Life. (arXiv:2311.18803v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</summary>
<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18803">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Images of the natural world, collected by a variety of cameras, from drones
to individual phones, are increasingly abundant sources of biological
information. There is an explosion of computational methods and tools,
particularly computer vision, for extracting biologically relevant information
from images for science and conservation. Yet most of these are bespoke
approaches designed for a specific task and are not easily adaptable or
extendable to new questions, contexts, and datasets. A vision model for general
organismal biology questions on images is of timely need. To approach this, we
curate and release TreeOfLife-10M, the largest and most diverse ML-ready
dataset of biology images. We then develop BioCLIP, a foundation model for the
tree of life, leveraging the unique properties of biology captured by
TreeOfLife-10M, namely the abundance and variety of images of plants, animals,
and fungi, together with the availability of rich structured biological
knowledge. We rigorously benchmark our approach on diverse fine-grained biology
classification tasks, and find that BioCLIP consistently and substantially
outperforms existing baselines (by 17% to 20% absolute). Intrinsic evaluation
reveals that BioCLIP has learned a hierarchical representation conforming to
the tree of life, shedding light on its strong generalizability. Our code,
models and data will be made available at
https://github.com/Imageomics/bioclip.

<summary class="article-expander__title">Event-driven Real-time Retrieval in Web Search. (arXiv:2312.00372v2 [cs.IR] UPDATED)</summary>
<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00372">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Information retrieval in real-time search presents unique challenges distinct
from those encountered in classical web search. These challenges are
particularly pronounced due to the rapid change of user search intent, which is
influenced by the occurrence and evolution of breaking news events, such as
earthquakes, elections, and wars. Previous dense retrieval methods, which
primarily focused on static semantic representation, lack the capacity to
capture immediate search intent, leading to inferior performance in retrieving
the most recent event-related documents in time-sensitive scenarios. To address
this issue, this paper expands the query with event information that represents
real-time search intent. The Event information is then integrated with the
query through a cross-attention mechanism, resulting in a time-context query
representation. We further enhance the model's capacity for event
representation through multi-task training. Since publicly available datasets
such as MS-MARCO do not contain any event information on the query side and
have few time-sensitive queries, we design an automatic data collection and
annotation pipeline to address this issue, which includes ModelZoo-based Coarse
Annotation and LLM-driven Fine Annotation processes. In addition, we share the
training tricks such as two-stage training and hard negative sampling. Finally,
we conduct a set of offline experiments on a million-scale production dataset
to evaluate our approach and deploy an A/B testing in a real online system to
verify the performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline
methods.
