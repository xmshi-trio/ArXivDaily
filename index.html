<span><p>Representations derived from models such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers) and HuBERT (Hidden units BERT), have helped
to achieve state-of-the-art performance in dimensional speech emotion
recognition. Despite their large dimensionality, and even though these
representations are not tailored for emotion recognition tasks, they are
frequently used to train large speech emotion models with high memory and
computational costs. In this work, we show that there exist lower-dimensional
subspaces within the these pre-trained representational spaces that offer a
reduction in downstream model complexity without sacrificing performance on
emotion estimation. In addition, we model label uncertainty in the form of
grader opinion variance, and demonstrate that such information can improve the
models generalization capacity and robustness. Finally, we compare the
robustness of the emotion models against acoustic degradations and observed
that the reduced dimensional representations were able to retain the
performance similar to the full-dimensional representations without significant
regression in dimensional emotion performance.

<span><p>Recent work found high mutual information between the learned representations

hinting an emergent internal model of space. However, whether this internal

that work, led to criticism of these findings as mere statistical correlation.
Our study focused on uncovering the causality of the spatial representations in
LLMs. In particular, we discovered the potential spatial representations in
DeBERTa, GPT-Neo using representational similarity analysis and linear and
non-linear probing. Our casual intervention experiments showed that the spatial

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16291">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>A key goal of current mechanistic interpretability research in NLP is to find
linear features (also called "feature vectors") for transformers: directions in
activation space corresponding to concepts that are used by a given model in
its computation. Present state-of-the-art methods for finding linear features
require large amounts of labelled data -- both laborious to acquire and
computationally expensive to utilize. In this work, we introduce a novel
method, called "observable propagation" (in short: ObsProp), for finding linear
features used by transformer language models in computing a given task -- using
almost no data. Our paradigm centers on the concept of observables, linear
functionals corresponding to given tasks. We then introduce a mathematical
theory for the analysis of feature vectors: we provide theoretical motivation
for why LayerNorm nonlinearities do not affect the direction of feature
vectors; we also introduce a similarity metric between feature vectors called
the coupling coefficient which estimates the degree to which one feature's
output correlates with another's. We use ObsProp to perform extensive
qualitative investigations into several tasks, including gendered occupational
bias, political party prediction, and programming language detection. Our
results suggest that ObsProp surpasses traditional approaches for finding
feature vectors in the low-data regime, and that ObsProp can be used to better
understand the mechanisms responsible for bias in large language models. Code

mono- and bi-argumental valence slots, which could be used, among others, as

Along with factors such as representativeness, grammatical correctness,
semantic coherence, frequency and the variety of lexical candidates, as well as
semantic classes and argument structures, which are fixed components of both

application of this prototype concept as well as of word embeddings together
with techniques from the field of automatic natural language processing and

<span><p>Large language models (LLMs) offer impressive performance in various
zero-shot and few-shot tasks. However, their success in zero-shot and few-shot
settings may be affected by task contamination, a potential limitation that has
not been thoroughly examined. This paper investigates how zero-shot and
few-shot performance of LLMs has changed chronologically over time. Utilizing
GPT-3 series models and several other recent open-sourced LLMs, and controlling
for dataset difficulty, we find that on datasets released before the LLM
training data creation date, LLMs perform surprisingly better than on datasets
released after. This strongly indicates that, for many LLMs, there exists task
contamination on zero-shot and few-shot evaluation for datasets released prior
to the LLMs' training data creation date. Additionally, we utilize training
data inspection, task example extraction, and a membership inference attack,
which reveal further evidence of task contamination. Importantly, we find that
for classification tasks with no possibility of task contamination, LLMs rarely
demonstrate statistically significant improvements over simple majority
baselines, in both zero and few-shot settings.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Generalized Category Discovery is a crucial real-world task. Despite the
improved performance on known categories, current methods perform poorly on
novel categories. We attribute the poor performance to two reasons: biased
knowledge transfer between labeled and unlabeled data and noisy representation
learning on the unlabeled data. To mitigate these two issues, we propose a
Transfer and Alignment Network (TAN), which incorporates two knowledge transfer
mechanisms to calibrate the biased knowledge and two feature alignment
mechanisms to learn discriminative features. Specifically, we model different
categories with prototypes and transfer the prototypes in labeled data to
correct model bias towards known categories. On the one hand, we pull instances
with known categories in unlabeled data closer to these prototypes to form more
compact clusters and avoid boundary overlap between known and novel categories.
On the other hand, we use these prototypes to calibrate noisy prototypes
estimated from unlabeled data based on category similarities, which allows for
more accurate estimation of prototypes for novel categories that can be used as
reliable learning targets later. After knowledge transfer, we further propose
two feature alignment mechanisms to acquire both instance- and category-level
knowledge from unlabeled data by aligning instance features with both augmented
features and the calibrated prototypes, which can boost model performance on
both known and novel categories with less noise. Experiments on three benchmark
datasets show that our model outperforms SOTA methods, especially on novel
categories. Theoretical analysis is provided for an in-depth understanding of
our model in general. Our code and data are available at

<span><p>Source code clone detection is the task of finding code fragments that have
the same or similar functionality, but may differ in syntax or structure. This
task is important for software maintenance, reuse, and quality assurance (Roy

be written in different languages, domains, and styles. In this paper, we argue
that source code is inherently a graph, not a sequence, and that graph-based
methods are more suitable for code clone detection than sequence-based methods.
We compare the performance of two state-of-the-art models: CodeBERT (Feng et

graph-based model, on two benchmark data-sets: BCB (Svajlenko et al. 2014) and

absence of a systematic news intent understanding framework hinders further
exploration of news intent and its downstream applications. To bridge this gap,
we propose News INTent (NINT) frame, the first component-aware formalism for

psychology, and cognitive science. Within this frame, we define the news intent

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Supplying data augmentation to conversational question answering (CQA) can
effectively improve model performance. However, there is less improvement from
single-turn datasets in CQA due to the distribution gap between single-turn and
multi-turn datasets. On the other hand, while numerous single-turn datasets are
available, we have not utilized them effectively. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel method to convert single-turn datasets to multi-turn datasets.
The proposed method consists of three parts, namely, a QA pair Generator, a QA
pair Reassembler, and a question Rewriter. Given a sample consisting of context
and single-turn QA pairs, the Generator obtains candidate QA pairs and a
knowledge graph based on the context. The Reassembler utilizes the knowledge
graph to get sequential QA pairs, and the Rewriter rewrites questions from a
conversational perspective to obtain a multi-turn dataset S2M. Our experiments
show that our method can synthesize effective training resources for CQA.

<span><p>In the In-Context Learning (ICL) setup, various forms of label biases can
manifest. One such manifestation is majority label bias, which arises when the
distribution of labeled examples in the in-context samples is skewed towards
one or more specific classes making Large Language Models (LLMs) more prone to
predict those labels. Such discrepancies can arise from various factors,
including logistical constraints, inherent biases in data collection methods,
limited access to diverse data sources, etc. which are unavoidable in a
real-world industry setup. In this work, we study the robustness of in-context
learning in LLMs to shifts that occur due to majority label bias within the
purview of text classification tasks. Prior works have shown that in-context
learning with LLMs is susceptible to such biases. In our study, we go one level
deeper and show that the robustness boundary varies widely for different models

Additionally, our findings also highlight the impact of model size and the

<span><p>BERT-based models have shown a remarkable ability in the Chinese Spelling
Check (CSC) task recently. However, traditional BERT-based methods still suffer
from two limitations. First, although previous works have identified that
explicit prior knowledge like Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging can benefit in the
CSC task, they neglected the fact that spelling errors inherent in CSC data can
lead to incorrect tags and therefore mislead models. Additionally, they ignored
the correlation between the implicit hierarchical information encoded by BERT's
intermediate layers and different linguistic phenomena. This results in
sub-optimal accuracy. To alleviate the above two issues, we design a
heterogeneous knowledge-infused framework to strengthen BERT-based CSC models.
To incorporate explicit POS knowledge, we utilize an auxiliary task strategy
driven by Gaussian mixture model. Meanwhile, to incorporate implicit
hierarchical linguistic knowledge within the encoder, we propose a novel form
of n-gram-based layerwise self-attention to generate a multilayer

<span><p>Event structures have emerged as a foundational model for concurrent
computation, explaining computational processes by outlining the events and the
relationships that dictate their execution. They play a pivotal role in the
study of key aspects of concurrent computation models, such as causality and
independence, and have found applications across a broad range of languages and
models, spanning realms like persistence, probabilities, and quantum computing.
Recently, event structures have been extended to address reversibility, where
computational processes can undo previous computations. In this context,
reversible event structures provide abstract representations of processes
capable of both forward and backward steps in a computation. Since their
introduction, event structures have played a crucial role in bridging
operational models, traditionally exemplified by Petri nets and process
calculi, with denotational ones, i.e., algebraic domains. In this context, we
revisit the standard connection between Petri nets and event structures under
the lenses of reversibility. Specifically, we introduce a subset of contextual
Petri nets, dubbed reversible causal nets, that precisely correspond to
reversible prime event structures. The distinctive feature of reversible causal
nets lies in deriving causality from inhibitor arcs, departing from the
conventional dependence on the overlap between the post and preset of
transitions. In this way, we are able to operationally explain the full model
of reversible prime event structures.

<span><p>With the release of increasing open-source emotion recognition datasets on
social media platforms and the rapid development of computing resources,
multimodal emotion recognition tasks (MER) have begun to receive widespread
research attention. The MER task extracts and fuses complementary semantic
information from different modalities, which can classify the speaker's
emotions. However, the existing feature fusion methods have usually mapped the
features of different modalities into the same feature space for information
fusion, which can not eliminate the heterogeneity between different modalities.
Therefore, it is challenging to make the subsequent emotion class boundary
learning. To tackle the above problems, we have proposed a novel Adversarial
Representation with Intra-Modal and Inter-Modal Graph Contrastive for
Multimodal Emotion Recognition (AR-IIGCN) method. Firstly, we input video,
audio, and text features into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to map them into
separate feature spaces. Secondly, we build a generator and a discriminator for
the three modal features through adversarial representation, which can achieve
information interaction between modalities and eliminate heterogeneity among
modalities. Thirdly, we introduce contrastive graph representation learning to
capture intra-modal and inter-modal complementary semantic information and
learn intra-class and inter-class boundary information of emotion categories.
Specifically, we construct a graph structure for three modal features and
perform contrastive representation learning on nodes with different emotions in
the same modality and the same emotion in different modalities, which can
improve the feature representation ability of nodes. Extensive experimental
works show that the ARL-IIGCN method can significantly improve emotion
recognition accuracy on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets.

<span><p>The impression is crucial for the referring physicians to grasp key
information since it is concluded from the findings and reasoning of
radiologists. To alleviate the workload of radiologists and reduce repetitive
human labor in impression writing, many researchers have focused on automatic
impression generation. However, recent works on this task mainly summarize the
corresponding findings and pay less attention to the radiology images. In
clinical, radiographs can provide more detailed valuable observations to
enhance radiologists' impression writing, especially for complicated cases.
Besides, each sentence in findings usually focuses on single anatomy, so they
only need to be matched to corresponding anatomical regions instead of the
whole image, which is beneficial for textual and visual features alignment.
Therefore, we propose a novel anatomy-enhanced multimodal model to promote
impression generation. In detail, we first construct a set of rules to extract
anatomies and put these prompts into each sentence to highlight anatomy
characteristics. Then, two separate encoders are applied to extract features
from the radiograph and findings. Afterward, we utilize a contrastive learning
module to align these two representations at the overall level and use a
co-attention to fuse them at the sentence level with the help of
anatomy-enhanced sentence representation. Finally, the decoder takes the fused

<span><p>Word embedding has become ubiquitous and is widely used in various natural
language processing (NLP) tasks, such as web retrieval, web semantic analysis,

in a relatively large corpus is prohibitively expensive. We propose a
graph-based word embedding algorithm, called Word-Graph2vec, which converts the
large corpus into a word co-occurrence graph, then takes the word sequence
samples from this graph by randomly traveling and trains the word embedding on
this sampling corpus in the end. We posit that because of the limited
vocabulary, huge idioms, and fixed expressions in English, the size and density
of the word co-occurrence graph change slightly with the increase in the
training corpus. So that Word-Graph2vec has stable runtime on the large-scale
data set, and its performance advantage becomes more and more obvious with the
growth of the training corpus. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world

<span><p>Multitask learning is widely used in practice to train a low-resource target
task by augmenting it with multiple related source tasks. Yet, naively
combining all the source tasks with a target task does not always improve the
prediction performance for the target task due to negative transfers. Thus, a
critical problem in multitask learning is identifying subsets of source tasks
that would benefit the target task. This problem is computationally challenging
since the number of subsets grows exponentially with the number of source
tasks; efficient heuristics for subset selection do not always capture the
relationship between task subsets and multitask learning performances. In this
paper, we introduce an efficient procedure to address this problem via
surrogate modeling. In surrogate modeling, we sample (random) subsets of source
tasks and precompute their multitask learning performances. Then, we
approximate the precomputed performances with a linear regression model that
can also predict the multitask performance of unseen task subsets. We show
theoretically and empirically that fitting this model only requires sampling
linearly many subsets in the number of source tasks. The fitted model provides
a relevance score between each source and target task. We use the relevance
scores to perform subset selection for multitask learning by thresholding.
Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach predicts negative
transfers from multiple source tasks to target tasks much more accurately than
existing task affinity measures. Additionally, we demonstrate that for several
weak supervision datasets, our approach consistently improves upon existing
optimization methods for multitask learning.

<span><p>Background: Injection drug use (IDU) is a dangerous health behavior that
increases mortality and morbidity. Identifying IDU early and initiating harm
reduction interventions can benefit individuals at risk. However, extracting
IDU behaviors from patients' electronic health records (EHR) is difficult
because there is no International Classification of Disease (ICD) code and the
only place IDU information can be indicated is unstructured free-text clinical
notes. Although natural language processing can efficiently extract this
information from unstructured data, there are no validated tools. Methods: To
address this gap in clinical information, we design and demonstrate a
question-answering (QA) framework to extract information on IDU from clinical
notes. Our framework involves two main steps: (1) generating a gold-standard QA
dataset and (2) developing and testing the QA model. We utilize 2323 clinical
notes of 1145 patients sourced from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse to
construct the gold-standard dataset for developing and evaluating the QA model.
We also demonstrate the QA model's ability to extract IDU-related information
on temporally out-of-distribution data. Results: Here we show that for a strict
match between gold-standard and predicted answers, the QA model achieves 51.65%
F1 score. For a relaxed match between the gold-standard and predicted answers,
the QA model obtains 78.03% F1 score, along with 85.38% Precision and 79.02%
Recall scores. Moreover, the QA model demonstrates consistent performance when
subjected to temporally out-of-distribution data. Conclusions: Our study
introduces a QA framework designed to extract IDU information from clinical
notes, aiming to enhance the accurate and efficient detection of people who
inject drugs, extract relevant information, and ultimately facilitate informed

constraining the generative capabilities of the models. In an effort to
mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel data collection methodology that
synchronously synthesizes images and dialogues for visual instruction tuning.
This approach harnesses the power of generative models, marrying the abilities
of ChatGPT and text-to-image generative models to yield a diverse and
controllable dataset with varied image content. Additionally, datasets can be
arbitrarily scaled. This not only provides greater flexibility compared to
existing methodologies but also significantly enhances several model
capabilities. Our research includes comprehensive experiments conducted on
various datasets. The results emphasize substantial enhancements in more than
ten commonly assessed capabilities. Additionally, our model achieves
state-of-the-art results across multiple widely recognized multimodal

<span><p>Text-based audio generation models have limitations as they cannot encompass
all the information in audio, leading to restricted controllability when
relying solely on text. To address this issue, we propose a novel model that
enhances the controllability of existing pre-trained text-to-audio models by
incorporating additional conditions including content (timestamp) and style
(pitch contour and energy contour) as supplements to the text. This approach
achieves fine-grained control over the temporal order, pitch, and energy of
generated audio. To preserve the diversity of generation, we employ a trainable
control condition encoder that is enhanced by a large language model and a
trainable Fusion-Net to encode and fuse the additional conditions while keeping
the weights of the pre-trained text-to-audio model frozen. Due to the lack of
suitable datasets and evaluation metrics, we consolidate existing datasets into
a new dataset comprising the audio and corresponding conditions and use a
series of evaluation metrics to evaluate the controllability performance.
Experimental results demonstrate that our model successfully achieves
fine-grained control to accomplish controllable audio generation. Audio samples

<span><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in
code generation. However, existing LLMs' decoding strategies are designed for
Natural Language (NL) generation, overlooking the differences between NL and
programming languages (PL). Due to this oversight, a better decoding strategy
for code generation remains an open question. In this paper, we conduct the
first systematic study to explore a decoding strategy specialized in code
generation. With an analysis of loss distributions of code tokens, we find that
code tokens can be divided into two categories: challenging tokens that are
difficult to predict and confident tokens that can be easily inferred. Among
them, the challenging tokens mainly appear at the beginning of a code block.
Inspired by the above findings, we propose a simple yet effective method:
Adaptive Temperature (AdapT) sampling, which dynamically adjusts the
temperature coefficient when decoding different tokens. We apply a larger
temperature when sampling for challenging tokens, allowing LLMs to explore
diverse choices. We employ a smaller temperature for confident tokens avoiding
the influence of tail randomness noises. We apply AdapT sampling to LLMs with
different sizes and conduct evaluations on two popular datasets. Results show
that AdapT sampling significantly outperforms state-of-the-art decoding
strategy.

<span><p>We propose PromptTTS++, a prompt-based text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis system

To control speaker identity within the prompt-based TTS framework, we introduce
the concept of speaker prompt, which describes voice characteristics (e.g.,
gender-neutral, young, old, and muffled) designed to be approximately
independent of speaking style. Since there is no large-scale dataset containing
speaker prompts, we first construct a dataset based on the LibriTTS-R corpus
with manually annotated speaker prompts. We then employ a diffusion-based
acoustic model with mixture density networks to model diverse speaker factors
in the training data. Unlike previous studies that rely on style prompts
describing only a limited aspect of speaker individuality, such as pitch,
speaking speed, and energy, our method utilizes an additional speaker prompt to
effectively learn the mapping from natural language descriptions to the
acoustic features of diverse speakers. Our subjective evaluation results show
that the proposed method can better control speaker characteristics than the
methods without the speaker prompt. Audio samples are available at

than "long" data. Based on this, we propose using the "original text
paraphrase" task, and successfully extend the context window of the existing
model to 32k by a low-cost and effective method, achieving the SOTA accuracy in
multi-document-QA among models of the same scale. The model and training data
have been open-sourced on
HuggingFace(https://huggingface.co/yuyijiong/Qwen-14b-chat-yarn-32k) and
WiseModel(https://wisemodel.cn/models/yuyijiong/Qwen-14b-chat-yarn-32k).

<span><p>Instruction tuning, a specialized technique to enhance large language model
(LLM) performance via instruction datasets, relies heavily on the quality of
employed data. Existing quality improvement methods alter instruction data
through dataset expansion or curation. However, the expansion method risks data
redundancy, potentially compromising LLM performance, while the curation
approach confines the LLM's potential to the original dataset. Our aim is to
surpass the original data quality without encountering these shortcomings. To
achieve this, we propose LIFT (LLM Instruction Fusion Transfer), a novel and
versatile paradigm designed to elevate the instruction quality to new heights.
LIFT strategically broadens data distribution to encompass more high-quality
subspaces and eliminates redundancy, concentrating on high-quality segments
across overall data subspaces. Experimental results demonstrate that, even with
a limited quantity of high-quality instruction data selected by our paradigm,
LLMs not only consistently uphold robust performance across various tasks but
also surpass some state-of-the-art results, highlighting the significant
improvement in instruction quality achieved by our paradigm.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12343">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Data contamination in evaluation is getting increasingly prevalent with the
emergence of language models pre-trained on super large, automatically crawled
corpora. This problem leads to significant challenges in the accurate
assessment of model capabilities and generalisations. In this paper, we propose
LatestEval, an automatic method that leverages the most recent texts to create
uncontaminated reading comprehension evaluations. LatestEval avoids data
contamination by only using texts published within a recent time window,
ensuring no overlap with the training corpora of pre-trained language models.
We develop the LatestEval automated pipeline to 1) gather the latest texts; 2)
identify key information, and 3) construct questions targeting the information
while removing the existing answers from the context. This encourages models to
infer the answers themselves based on the remaining context, rather than just
copy-paste. Our experiments demonstrate that language models exhibit negligible
memorisation behaviours on LatestEval as opposed to previous benchmarks,
suggesting a significantly reduced risk of data contamination and leading to a
more robust evaluation. Data and code are publicly available at:

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14183">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>While large language models (LLMs) have taken great strides towards helping
humans with a plethora of tasks like search and summarization, hallucinations
remain a major impediment towards gaining user trust. The fluency and coherence
of model generations even when hallucinating makes it difficult to detect
whether or not a model is hallucinating. In this work, we explore if the
artifacts associated with the model generations can provide hints that the
generation will contain hallucinations. Specifically, we probe LLMs at 1) the
inputs via Integrated Gradients based token attribution, 2) the outputs via the
Softmax probabilities, and 3) the internal state via self-attention and
fully-connected layer activations for signs of hallucinations on open-ended
question answering tasks. Our results show that the distributions of these
artifacts differ between hallucinated and non-hallucinated generations.
Building on this insight, we train binary classifiers that use these artifacts
as input features to classify model generations into hallucinations and
non-hallucinations. These hallucination classifiers achieve up to 0.80 AUROC.
We further show that tokens preceding a hallucination can predict the
subsequent hallucination before it occurs.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15291">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>With the proliferation of dialogic data across the Internet, the Dialogue
Commonsense Multi-choice Question Answering (DC-MCQ) task has emerged as a
response to the challenge of comprehending user queries and intentions.
Although prevailing methodologies exhibit effectiveness in addressing
single-choice questions, they encounter difficulties in handling multi-choice
queries due to the heightened intricacy and informational density. In this
paper, inspired by the human cognitive process of progressively excluding
options, we propose a three-step Reverse Exclusion Graph-of-Thought (ReX-GoT)
framework, including Option Exclusion, Error Analysis, and Combine Information.
Specifically, our ReX-GoT mimics human reasoning by gradually excluding
irrelevant options and learning the reasons for option errors to choose the
optimal path of the GoT and ultimately infer the correct answer. By
progressively integrating intricate clues, our method effectively reduces the
difficulty of multi-choice reasoning and provides a novel solution for DC-MCQ.
Extensive experiments on the CICERO and CICERO$_{v2}$ datasets validate the
significant improvement of our approach on DC-MCQ task. On zero-shot setting,
our model outperform the best baseline by 17.67% in terms of F1 score for the
multi-choice task. Most strikingly, our GPT3.5-based ReX-GoT framework achieves
a remarkable 39.44% increase in F1 score.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16148">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>The way the media presents events can significantly affect public perception,
which in turn can alter people's beliefs and views. Media bias describes a
one-sided or polarizing perspective on a topic. This article summarizes the
research on computational methods to detect media bias by systematically
reviewing 3140 research papers published between 2019 and 2022. To structure
our review and support a mutual understanding of bias across research domains,
we introduce the Media Bias Taxonomy, which provides a coherent overview of the
current state of research on media bias from different perspectives. We show
that media bias detection is a highly active research field, in which
transformer-based classification approaches have led to significant
improvements in recent years. These improvements include higher classification
accuracy and the ability to detect more fine-granular types of bias. However,
we have identified a lack of interdisciplinarity in existing projects, and a
need for more awareness of the various types of media bias to support
methodologically thorough performance evaluations of media bias detection
systems. Concluding from our analysis, we see the integration of recent machine
learning advancements with reliable and diverse bias assessment strategies from
other research areas as the most promising area for future research
contributions in the field.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14654">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Multiple intent detection and slot filling are two fundamental and crucial
tasks in spoken language understanding. Motivated by the fact that the two
tasks are closely related, joint models that can detect intents and extract
slots simultaneously are preferred to individual models that perform each task
independently. The accuracy of a joint model depends heavily on the ability of
the model to transfer information between the two tasks so that the result of
one task can correct the result of the other. In addition, since a joint model
has multiple outputs, how to train the model effectively is also challenging.
In this paper, we present a method for multiple intent detection and slot
filling by addressing these challenges. First, we propose a bidirectional joint
model that explicitly employs intent information to recognize slots and slot
features to detect intents. Second, we introduce a novel method for training
the proposed joint model using supervised contrastive learning and
self-distillation. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets MixATIS and
MixSNIPS show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both
tasks. The results also demonstrate the contributions of both bidirectional
design and the training method to the accuracy improvement. Our source code is
