<summary class="article-expander__title">Schema-learning and rebinding as mechanisms of in-context learning and emergence. (arXiv:2307.01201v1 [cs.CL])</summary>
<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01201">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>In-context learning (ICL) is one of the most powerful and most unexpected
capabilities to emerge in recent transformer-based large language models
(LLMs). Yet the mechanisms that underlie it are poorly understood. In this
paper, we demonstrate that comparable ICL capabilities can be acquired by an
alternative sequence prediction learning method using clone-structured causal
graphs (CSCGs). Moreover, a key property of CSCGs is that, unlike
transformer-based LLMs, they are {\em interpretable}, which considerably
simplifies the task of explaining how ICL works. Specifically, we show that it
uses a combination of (a) learning template (schema) circuits for pattern
completion, (b) retrieving relevant templates in a context-sensitive manner,
and (c) rebinding of novel tokens to appropriate slots in the templates. We go
on to marshall evidence for the hypothesis that similar mechanisms underlie ICL
in LLMs. For example, we find that, with CSCGs as with LLMs, different
capabilities emerge at different levels of overparameterization, suggesting
that overparameterization helps in learning more complex template (schema)
circuits. By showing how ICL can be achieved with small models and datasets, we
open up a path to novel architectures, and take a vital step towards a more
general understanding of the mechanics behind this important capability.

<span><p>Analysis of innovation has been fundamentally limited by conventional
approaches to broad, structural variables. This paper pushes the boundaries,
taking an LLM approach to patent analysis with the groundbreaking ChatGPT
technology. OpenAI's state-of-the-art textual embedding accesses complex
information about the quality and impact of each invention to power deep
learning predictive models. The nuanced embedding drives a 24% incremental
improvement in R-squared predicting patent value and clearly isolates the worst
and best applications. These models enable a revision of the contemporary
Kogan, Papanikolaou, Seru, and Stoffman (2017) valuation of patents by a median
deviation of 1.5 times, accounting for potential institutional predictions.
Furthermore, the market fails to incorporate timely information about
applications; a long-short portfolio based on predicted acceptance rates
achieves significant abnormal returns of 3.3% annually. The models provide an
opportunity to revolutionize startup and small-firm corporate policy vis-a-vis

<span><p>Machine learning techniques have shown their competence for representing and
reasoning in symbolic systems such as language and phonology. In Sinitic
Historical Phonology, notable tasks that could benefit from machine learning
include the comparison of dialects and reconstruction of proto-languages
systems. Motivated by this, this paper provides an approach for obtaining
multi-dialectal representations of Sinitic syllables, by constructing a
knowledge graph from structured phonological data, then applying the BoxE
technique from knowledge base learning. We applied unsupervised clustering
techniques to the obtained representations to observe that the representations
capture phonemic contrast from the input dialects. Furthermore, we trained
classifiers to perform inference of unobserved Middle Chinese labels, showing
the representations' potential for indicating archaic, proto-language features.
The representations can be used for performing completion of fragmented Sinitic
phonological knowledge bases, estimating divergences between different
characters, or aiding the exploration and reconstruction of archaic features.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Large documents written in juridical language are difficult to interpret,
with long sentences leading to intricate and intertwined relations between the

security directives. The complexity of their language is here thwarted by
automating the extraction of the relevant information, namely of the parts of
speech from each clause, through a specific tailoring of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques. These contribute, in combination with ontology
development principles, to the design of our automated method for the
representation of security directives as ontologies. The method is showcased on
a practical problem, namely to derive an ontology representing the NIS 2

Although the NLP techniques adopted showed some limitations and had to be
complemented by manual analysis, the overall results provide valid support for
directive compliance in general and for ontology development in particular.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01214">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Despite large-scale pre-trained language models have achieved striking
results for text classificaion, recent work has raised concerns about the
challenge of shortcut learning. In general, a keyword is regarded as a shortcut
if it creates a superficial association with the label, resulting in a false
prediction. Conversely, shortcut learning can be mitigated if the model relies
on robust causal features that help produce sound predictions. To this end,
many studies have explored post-hoc interpretable methods to mine shortcuts and
causal features for robustness and generalization. However, most existing
methods focus only on single word in a sentence and lack consideration of
word-group, leading to wrong causal features. To solve this problem, we propose
a new Word-Group mining approach, which captures the causal effect of any
keyword combination and orders the combinations that most affect the
prediction. Our approach bases on effective post-hoc analysis and beam search,
which ensures the mining effect and reduces the complexity. Then, we build a
counterfactual augmentation method based on the multiple word-groups, and use
an adaptive voting mechanism to learn the influence of different augmentated
samples on the prediction results, so as to force the model to pay attention to
effective causal features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method by several tasks on 8 affective review datasets and 4 toxic language
datasets, including cross-domain text classificaion, text attack and gender
fairness test.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01216">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>The difficulties of automatic extraction of definitions and methods from
scientific documents lie in two aspects: (1) the complexity and diversity of
natural language texts, which requests an analysis method to support the
discovery of pattern; and, (2) a complete definition or method represented by a
scientific paper is usually distributed within text, therefore an effective
approach should not only extract single sentence definitions and methods but
also integrate the sentences to obtain a complete definition or method. This
paper proposes an analysis method for discovering patterns of definition and
method and uses the method to discover patterns of definition and method.
Completeness of the patterns at the semantic level is guaranteed by a complete
set of semantic relations that identify definitions and methods respectively.
The completeness of the patterns at the syntactic and lexical levels is
guaranteed by syntactic and lexical constraints. Experiments on the self-built
dataset and two public definition datasets show that the discovered patterns
are effective. The patterns can be used to extract definitions and methods from
scientific documents and can be tailored or extended to suit other
applications.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01225">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Transformer-based text classifiers like BERT, Roberta, T5, and GPT-3 have
shown impressive performance in NLP. However, their vulnerability to
adversarial examples poses a security risk. Existing defense methods lack
interpretability, making it hard to understand adversarial classifications and
identify model vulnerabilities. To address this, we propose the
Interpretability and Transparency-Driven Detection and Transformation (IT-DT)
framework. It focuses on interpretability and transparency in detecting and
transforming textual adversarial examples. IT-DT utilizes techniques like
attention maps, integrated gradients, and model feedback for interpretability
during detection. This helps identify salient features and perturbed words
contributing to adversarial classifications. In the transformation phase, IT-DT
uses pre-trained embeddings and model feedback to generate optimal replacements
for perturbed words. By finding suitable substitutions, we aim to convert
adversarial examples into non-adversarial counterparts that align with the
model's intended behavior while preserving the text's meaning. Transparency is
emphasized through human expert involvement. Experts review and provide
feedback on detection and transformation results, enhancing decision-making,
especially in complex scenarios. The framework generates insights and threat
intelligence empowering analysts to identify vulnerabilities and improve model
robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IT-DT in
detecting and transforming adversarial examples. The approach enhances
interpretability, provides transparency, and enables accurate identification
and successful transformation of adversarial inputs. By combining technical
analysis and human expertise, IT-DT significantly improves the resilience and
trustworthiness of transformer-based text classifiers against adversarial

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recently, Neural Topic Models (NTM), inspired by variational autoencoders,
have attracted a lot of research interest; however, these methods have limited
applications in the real world due to the challenge of incorporating human
knowledge. This work presents a semi-supervised neural topic modeling method,
vONTSS, which uses von Mises-Fisher (vMF) based variational autoencoders and
optimal transport. When a few keywords per topic are provided, vONTSS in the
semi-supervised setting generates potential topics and optimizes topic-keyword
quality and topic classification. Experiments show that vONTSS outperforms
existing semi-supervised topic modeling methods in classification accuracy and
diversity. vONTSS also supports unsupervised topic modeling. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments show that vONTSS in the unsupervised setting
outperforms recent NTMs on multiple aspects: vONTSS discovers highly clustered
and coherent topics on benchmark datasets. It is also much faster than the
state-of-the-art weakly supervised text classification method while achieving
similar classification performance. We further prove the equivalence of optimal
transport loss and cross-entropy loss at the global minimum.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>The current advances in generative AI for learning large neural network
models with the capability to produce essays, images, music and even 3D assets
from text prompts create opportunities for a manifold of disciplines. In the
present paper, we study the potential of deep text-to-3D models in the
engineering domain, with focus on the chances and challenges when integrating
and interacting with 3D assets in computational simulation-based design
optimization. In contrast to traditional design optimization of 3D geometries
that often searches for the optimum designs using numerical representations,
such as B-Spline surface or deformation parameters in vehicle aerodynamic
optimization, natural language challenges the optimization framework by
requiring a different interpretation of variation operators while at the same
time may ease and motivate the human user interaction. Here, we propose and
realize a fully automated evolutionary design optimization framework using
Shap-E, a recently published text-to-3D asset network by OpenAI, in the context
of aerodynamic vehicle optimization. For representing text prompts in the
evolutionary optimization, we evaluate (a) a bag-of-words approach based on
prompt templates and Wordnet samples, and (b) a tokenisation approach based on
prompt templates and the byte pair encoding method from GPT4. Our main findings
from the optimizations indicate that, first, it is important to ensure that the
designs generated from prompts are within the object class of application, i.e.
diverse and novel designs need to be realistic, and, second, that more research
is required to develop methods where the strength of text prompt variations and
the resulting variations of the 3D designs share causal relations to some
degree to improve the optimization.

<span><p>Recent advancements in Named Entity Recognition (NER) have significantly

spoken NER has remained unexplored. This paper utilizes transfer learning
across Dutch, English, and German using pipeline and End-to-End (E2E) schemes.
We employ Wav2Vec2-XLS-R models on custom pseudo-annotated datasets and

pipeline-based alternatives over our limited annotations. Notably, transfer
learning from German to Dutch surpasses the Dutch E2E system by 7% and the

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in Natural
Language Generation, it is still challenging to characterize the uncertainty of
model generations, i.e., when users could trust model outputs. Our research is
derived from the heuristic facts that tokens are created unequally in
reflecting the meaning of generations by auto-regressive LLMs, i.e., some
tokens are more relevant (or representative) than others, yet all the tokens
are equally valued when estimating uncertainty. It is because of the linguistic
redundancy where mostly a few keywords are sufficient to convey the meaning of
a long sentence. We name these inequalities as generative inequalities and
investigate how they affect uncertainty estimation. Our results reveal that
considerable tokens and sentences containing limited semantics are weighted
equally or even heavily when estimating uncertainty. To tackle these biases
posed by generative inequalities, we propose to jointly Shifting Attention to
more Relevant (SAR) components from both the token level and the sentence level
while estimating uncertainty. We conduct experiments over popular
"off-the-shelf" LLMs (e.g., OPT, LLaMA) with model sizes up to 30B and powerful
commercial LLMs (e.g., Davinci from OpenAI), across various free-form

<span><p>Simultaneous speech translation is an essential communication task difficult
for humans whereby a translation is generated concurrently with oncoming speech

reduced cost. Current methods to allow information to propagate across

<span><p>Structured chemical reaction information plays a vital role for chemists
engaged in laboratory work and advanced endeavors such as computer-aided drug
design. Despite the importance of extracting structured reactions from
scientific literature, data annotation for this purpose is cost-prohibitive due
to the significant labor required from domain experts. Consequently, the
scarcity of sufficient training data poses an obstacle to the progress of
related models in this domain. In this paper, we propose ReactIE, which
combines two weakly supervised approaches for pre-training. Our method utilizes
frequent patterns within the text as linguistic cues to identify specific
characteristics of chemical reactions. Additionally, we adopt synthetic data
from patent records as distant supervision to incorporate domain knowledge into
the model. Experiments demonstrate that ReactIE achieves substantial
improvements and outperforms all existing baselines.

<span><p>There has been significant interest in zero and few-shot learning for
dialogue state tracking (DST) due to the high cost of collecting and annotating
task-oriented dialogues. Recent work has demonstrated that in-context learning
requires very little data and zero parameter updates, and even outperforms
trained methods in the few-shot setting (Hu et al. 2022). We propose RefPyDST,
which advances the state of the art with three advancements to in-context
learning for DST. First, we formulate DST as a Python programming task,
explicitly modeling language coreference as variable reference in Python.
Second, since in-context learning depends highly on the context examples, we
propose a method to retrieve a diverse set of relevant examples to improve
performance. Finally, we introduce a novel re-weighting method during decoding
that takes into account probabilities of competing surface forms, and produces
a more accurate dialogue state prediction. We evaluate our approach using
MultiWOZ and achieve state-of-the-art multi-domain joint-goal accuracy in zero

<span><p>The recent advances in NLP, have led to a new trend of applying LLMs to
real-world scenarios. While the latest LLMs are astonishingly fluent when
interacting with humans, they suffer from the misinformation problem by
unintentionally generating factually false statements. This can lead to harmful
consequences, especially when produced within sensitive contexts, such as
healthcare. Yet few previous works have focused on evaluating misinformation in
the long-form generation of LLMs, especially for knowledge-intensive topics.
Moreover, although LLMs have been shown to perform well in different languages,
misinformation evaluation has been mostly conducted in English. To this end, we
present a benchmark, CARE-MI, for evaluating LLM misinformation in: 1) a
sensitive topic, specifically the maternity and infant care domain; and 2) a
language other than English, namely Chinese. Most importantly, we provide an
innovative paradigm for building long-form generation evaluation benchmarks
that can be transferred to other knowledge-intensive domains and low-resourced
languages. Our proposed benchmark fills the gap between the extensive usage of
LLMs and the lack of datasets for assessing the misinformation generated by
these models. It contains 1,612 expert-checked questions, accompanied with
human-selected references. Using our benchmark, we conduct extensive
experiments and found that current Chinese LLMs are far from perfect in the
topic of maternity and infant care. In an effort to minimize the reliance on
human resources for performance evaluation, we offer a judgment model for
automatically assessing the long-form output of LLMs using the benchmark
questions. Moreover, we compare potential solutions for long-form generation
evaluation and provide insights for building more robust and efficient
automated metric.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Despite their promising performance across various natural language
processing (NLP) tasks, current NLP systems are vulnerable to textual
adversarial attacks. To defend against these attacks, most existing methods
apply adversarial training by incorporating adversarial examples. However,
these methods have to rely on ground-truth labels to generate adversarial
examples, rendering it impractical for large-scale model pre-training which is
commonly used nowadays for NLP and many other tasks. In this paper, we propose
a novel learning framework called SCAT (Self-supervised Contrastive Learning
via Adversarial Training), which can learn robust representations without
requiring labeled data. Specifically, SCAT modifies random augmentations of the
data in a fully labelfree manner to generate adversarial examples. Adversarial
training is achieved by minimizing the contrastive loss between the
augmentations and their adversarial counterparts. We evaluate SCAT on two text
classification datasets using two state-of-the-art attack schemes proposed
recently. Our results show that SCAT can not only train robust language models
from scratch, but it can also significantly improve the robustness of existing
pre-trained language models. Moreover, to demonstrate its flexibility, we show
that SCAT can also be combined with supervised adversarial training to further
enhance model robustness.

naive practice with ChatGPT in a non-trivial task, and finally (iii) applying

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>As the representation capability of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs)
improve, there is growing concern that they will inherit social biases from
unprocessed corpora. Most previous debiasing techniques used Counterfactual
Data Augmentation (CDA) to balance the training corpus. However, CDA slightly
modifies the original corpus, limiting the representation distance between
different demographic groups to a narrow range. As a result, the debiasing
model easily fits the differences between counterfactual pairs, which affects
its debiasing performance with limited text resources. In this paper, we
propose an adversarial training-inspired two-stage debiasing model using
Contrastive learning with Continuous Prompt Augmentation (named CCPA) to
mitigate social biases in PLMs' encoding. In the first stage, we propose a data
augmentation method based on continuous prompt tuning to push farther the
representation distance between sample pairs along different demographic
groups. In the second stage, we utilize contrastive learning to pull closer the
representation distance between the augmented sample pairs and then fine-tune
PLMs' parameters to get debiased encoding. Our approach guides the model to
achieve stronger debiasing performance by adding difficulty to the training

debiasing performance. Meanwhile, experimental results on the GLUE benchmark

the StyleGAN family of image synthesis models, ASGAN maps sampled noise to a
disentangled latent vector which is then mapped to a sequence of audio features

ASGAN, we introduce a number of new techniques, including a modification to
adaptive discriminator augmentation which probabilistically skips discriminator

diffusion models. We confirm that ASGAN's latent space is disentangled: we
demonstrate how simple linear operations in the space can be used to perform
several tasks unseen during training. Specifically, we perform evaluations in
voice conversion, speech enhancement, speaker verification, and keyword

<span><p>Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) is a widely used criterion for
training supervised sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. It enables learning
the relations between input and output sequences, termed alignments, by
marginalizing over perfect alignments (that yield the ground truth), at the
expense of imperfect alignments. This binary differentiation of perfect and
imperfect alignments falls short of capturing other essential alignment
properties that hold significance in other real-world applications. Here we
propose $\textit{Align With Purpose}$, a $\textbf{general Plug-and-Play

criterion. We do that by complementing the CTC with an additional loss term
that prioritizes alignments according to a desired property. Our method does
not require any intervention in the CTC loss function, enables easy
optimization of a variety of properties, and allows differentiation between
both perfect and imperfect alignments. We apply our framework in the domain of
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and show its generality in terms of property
selection, architectural choice, and scale of training dataset (up to 280,000
hours). To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we apply it to two
unrelated properties: emission time and word error rate (WER). For the former,
we report an improvement of up to 570ms in latency optimization with a minor
reduction in WER, and for the latter, we report a relative improvement of 4.5%

<span><p>In tasks like semantic parsing, instruction following, and question
answering, standard deep networks fail to generalize compositionally from small
datasets. Many existing approaches overcome this limitation with model
architectures that enforce a compositional process of sentence interpretation.
In this paper, we present a domain-general and model-agnostic formulation of
compositionality as a constraint on symmetries of data distributions rather
than models. Informally, we prove that whenever a task can be solved by a
compositional model, there is a corresponding data augmentation scheme -- a
procedure for transforming examples into other well formed examples -- that
imparts compositional inductive bias on any model trained to solve the same
task. We describe a procedure called LEXSYM that discovers these
transformations automatically, then applies them to training data for ordinary
neural sequence models. Unlike existing compositional data augmentation
procedures, LEXSYM can be deployed agnostically across text, structured data,
and even images. It matches or surpasses state-of-the-art, task-specific models
on COGS semantic parsing, SCAN and ALCHEMY instruction following, and
CLEVR-COGENT visual question answering datasets.

<span><p>Continual Learning (CL) methods focus on accumulating knowledge over time
while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Recently, Wortsman et al. (2020)
proposed a CL method, SupSup, which uses a randomly initialized, fixed base
network (model) and finds a supermask for each new task that selectively keeps
or removes each weight to produce a subnetwork. They prevent forgetting as the
network weights are not being updated. Although there is no forgetting, the
performance of SupSup is sub-optimal because fixed weights restrict its
representational power. Furthermore, there is no accumulation or transfer of
knowledge inside the model when new tasks are learned. Hence, we propose
ExSSNeT (Exclusive Supermask SubNEtwork Training), that performs exclusive and
non-overlapping subnetwork weight training. This avoids conflicting updates to
the shared weights by subsequent tasks to improve performance while still
preventing forgetting. Furthermore, we propose a novel KNN-based Knowledge
Transfer (KKT) module that utilizes previously acquired knowledge to learn new
tasks better and faster. We demonstrate that ExSSNeT outperforms strong
previous methods on both NLP and Vision domains while preventing forgetting.
Moreover, ExSSNeT is particularly advantageous for sparse masks that activate
2-10% of the model parameters, resulting in an average improvement of 8.3% over
SupSup. Furthermore, ExSSNeT scales to a large number of tasks (100). Our code

<span><p>Transformer-based Language Models (LMs) have achieved impressive results on
natural language understanding tasks, but they can also generate toxic text

detoxify toxic texts using additional LMs or perturbations. However, previous

propose an effective yet efficient method for language detoxification using an
attribute-discriminative latent space. Specifically, we project the latent
space of an original Transformer LM onto a discriminative latent space that
well-separates texts by their attributes using a projection block and an
attribute discriminator. This allows the LM to control the text generation to
be non-toxic with minimal memory and computation overhead. We validate our

<span><p>Data augmentation is a widely used technique in machine learning to improve
model performance. However, existing data augmentation techniques in natural
language understanding (NLU) may not fully capture the complexity of natural
language variations, and they can be challenging to apply to large datasets.
This paper proposes the Random Position Noise (RPN) algorithm, a novel data
augmentation technique that operates at the word vector level. RPN modifies the
word embeddings of the original text by introducing noise based on the existing
values of selected word vectors, allowing for more fine-grained modifications
and better capturing natural language variations. Unlike traditional data
augmentation methods, RPN does not require gradients in the computational graph
during virtual sample updates, making it simpler to apply to large datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that RPN consistently outperforms existing
data augmentation techniques across various NLU tasks, including sentiment
analysis, natural language inference, and paraphrase detection. Moreover, RPN
performs well in low-resource settings and is applicable to any model featuring
a word embeddings layer. The proposed RPN algorithm is a promising approach for
enhancing NLU performance and addressing the challenges associated with
traditional data augmentation techniques in large-scale NLU tasks. Our
experimental results demonstrated that the RPN algorithm achieved
state-of-the-art performance in all seven NLU tasks, thereby highlighting its

embeddings requires a full forward and backward pass over the entire model. We
propose mini-model adaptation, a compute-efficient alternative that builds a
shallow mini-model from a fraction of a large model's parameters. New
language-specific embeddings can then be efficiently trained over the
mini-model and plugged into the aligned large model for rapid cross-lingual
transfer. We explore two approaches to learn mini-models: MiniJoint, which
jointly pretrains the primary model and the mini-model using a single

start from a regular pretrained model, build a mini-model by extracting and
freezing a few layers, and learn a small number of parameters on top.

<span><p>Despite recent progress towards scaling up multimodal vision-language models,
these models are still known to struggle on compositional generalization
benchmarks such as Winoground. We find that a critical component lacking from
current vision-language models is relation-level alignment: the ability to
match directional semantic relations in text (e.g., "mug in grass") with
spatial relationships in the image (e.g., the position of the mug relative to
the grass). To tackle this problem, we show that relation alignment can be
enforced by encouraging the directed language attention from 'mug' to 'grass'
(capturing the semantic relation 'in') to match the directed visual attention
from the mug to the grass. Tokens and their corresponding objects are softly
identified using the cross-modal attention. We prove that this notion of soft
relation alignment is equivalent to enforcing congruence between vision and
language attention matrices under a 'change of basis' provided by the
cross-modal attention matrix. Intuitively, our approach projects visual
attention into the language attention space to calculate its divergence from
the actual language attention, and vice versa. We apply our Cross-modal

Direct finetuning on individual downstream tasks devoid of instruction tuning;
(ii) Instructiontuning followed by in-context few-shot or zero-shot

MoE models overall underperform dense models of identical computational

<span><p>In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing
pre-trained language models for NLP. However, these models often struggle when
fine-tuned on small datasets. To address this issue, researchers have proposed
various adaptation approaches. Prompt-based tuning is arguably the most common
way, especially for larger models. Previous research shows that adding
contrastive learning to prompt-based fine-tuning is effective as it helps the
model generate embeddings that are more distinguishable between classes, and it
can also be more sample-efficient as the model learns from positive and
negative examples simultaneously. One of the most important components of
contrastive learning is data augmentation, but unlike computer vision,
effective data augmentation for NLP is still challenging. This paper proposes
LM-CPPF, Contrastive Paraphrasing-guided Prompt-based Fine-tuning of Language
Models, which leverages prompt-based few-shot paraphrasing using generative
language models, especially large language models such as GPT-3 and OPT-175B,
for data augmentation. Our experiments on multiple text classification
benchmarks show that this augmentation method outperforms other methods, such
as easy data augmentation, back translation, and multiple templates.

<span><p>This paper presents a method for building a personalized open-domain dialogue
system to address the WWH (WHAT, WHEN, and HOW) problem for natural response
generation in a commercial setting, where personalized dialogue responses are
heavily interleaved with casual response turns. The proposed approach involves
weighted dataset blending, negative persona information augmentation methods,
and the design of personalized conversation datasets to address the challenges
of WWH in personalized, open-domain dialogue systems. Our work effectively
balances dialogue fluency and tendency to ground, while also introducing a
response-type label to improve the controllability and explainability of the
grounded responses. The combination of these methods leads to more fluent
conversations, as evidenced by subjective human evaluations as well as
objective evaluations.

<span><p>This article investigates the knowledge transfer from the RuQTopics dataset.
This Russian topical dataset combines a large sample number (361,560
single-label, 170,930 multi-label) with extensive class coverage (76 classes).
We have prepared this dataset from the "Yandex Que" raw data. By evaluating the
RuQTopics - trained models on the six matching classes of the Russian MASSIVE
subset, we have proved that the RuQTopics dataset is suitable for real-world
conversational tasks, as the Russian-only models trained on this dataset
consistently yield an accuracy around 85\% on this subset. We also have figured
out that for the multilingual BERT, trained on the RuQTopics and evaluated on
the same six classes of MASSIVE (for all MASSIVE languages), the language-wise
accuracy closely correlates (Spearman correlation 0.773 with p-value 2.997e-11)
with the approximate size of the pretraining BERT's data for the corresponding
language. At the same time, the correlation of the language-wise accuracy with
the linguistical distance from Russian is not statistically significant.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12245">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Entity Linking (EL) is a fundamental task for Information Extraction and
Knowledge Graphs. The general form of EL (i.e., end-to-end EL) aims to first
find mentions in the given input document and then link the mentions to
corresponding entities in a specific knowledge base. Recently, the paradigm of
retriever-reader promotes the progress of end-to-end EL, benefiting from the
advantages of dense entity retrieval and machine reading comprehension.
However, the existing study only trains the retriever and the reader separately
in a pipeline manner, which ignores the benefit that the interaction between
the retriever and the reader can bring to the task. To advance the
retriever-reader paradigm to perform more perfectly on end-to-end EL, we
propose BEER$^2$, a Bidirectional End-to-End training framework for Retriever
and Reader. Through our designed bidirectional end-to-end training, BEER$^2$
guides the retriever and the reader to learn from each other, make progress
together, and ultimately improve EL performance. Extensive experiments on
benchmarks of multiple domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
BEER$^2$.

<span><p>Biomedical named entity recognition (BNER) serves as the foundation for
numerous biomedical text mining tasks. Unlike general NER, BNER require a
comprehensive grasp of the domain, and incorporating external knowledge beyond
training data poses a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a novel
BNER framework called DMNER. By leveraging existing entity representation
models SAPBERT, we tackle BNER as a two-step process: entity boundary detection
and biomedical entity matching. DMNER exhibits applicability across multiple
NER scenarios: 1) In supervised NER, we observe that DMNER effectively
rectifies the output of baseline NER models, thereby further enhancing
performance. 2) In distantly supervised NER, combining MRC and AutoNER as span
boundary detectors enables DMNER to achieve satisfactory results. 3) For
training NER by merging multiple datasets, we adopt a framework similar to
DS-NER but additionally leverage ChatGPT to obtain high-quality phrases in the
training. Through extensive experiments conducted on 10 benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of DMNER.

<span><p>Scanned historical maps in libraries and archives are valuable repositories
of geographic data that often do not exist elsewhere. Despite the potential of
machine learning tools like the Google Vision APIs for automatically
transcribing text from these maps into machine-readable formats, they do not
work well with large-sized images (e.g., high-resolution scanned documents),
cannot infer the relation between the recognized text and other datasets, and
are challenging to integrate with post-processing tools. This paper introduces
the mapKurator system, an end-to-end system integrating machine learning models
with a comprehensive data processing pipeline. mapKurator empowers automated
extraction, post-processing, and linkage of text labels from large numbers of
large-dimension historical map scans. The output data, comprising bounding
polygons and recognized text, is in the standard GeoJSON format, making it
easily modifiable within Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The proposed
system allows users to quickly generate valuable data from large numbers of
historical maps for in-depth analysis of the map content and, in turn,
encourages map findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability
(FAIR principles). We deployed the mapKurator system and enabled the processing
of over 60,000 maps and over 100 million text/place names in the David Rumsey
Historical Map collection. We also demonstrated a seamless integration of
mapKurator with a collaborative web platform to enable accessing automated
approaches for extracting and linking text labels from historical map scans and
collective work to improve the results.

<span><p>Recommender systems play a crucial role in helping users discover information
that aligns with their interests based on their past behaviors. However,
developing personalized recommendation systems becomes challenging when
historical records of user-item interactions are unavailable, leading to what
is known as the system cold-start recommendation problem. This issue is
particularly prominent in start-up businesses or platforms with insufficient
user engagement history. Previous studies focus on user or item cold-start
scenarios, where systems could make recommendations for new users or items but
are still trained with historical user-item interactions in the same domain,
which cannot solve our problem. To bridge the gap, our research introduces an
innovative and effective approach, capitalizing on the capabilities of
pre-trained language models. We transform the recommendation process into
sentiment analysis of natural languages containing information of user profiles
and item attributes, where the sentiment polarity is predicted with prompt
learning. By harnessing the extensive knowledge housed within language models,
the prediction can be made without historical user-item interaction records. A
benchmark is also introduced to evaluate the proposed method under the
cold-start setting, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to tackle the
system cold-start recommendation problem. The benchmark and implementation of
the method are available at https://github.com/JacksonWuxs/PromptRec.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01163">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Pretrained language models (PLMs) are today the primary model for natural
language processing. Despite their impressive downstream performance, it can be
difficult to apply PLMs to new languages, a barrier to making their
capabilities universally accessible. While prior work has shown it possible to
address this issue by learning a new embedding layer for the new language,
doing so is both data and compute inefficient. We propose to use an active
forgetting mechanism during pretraining, as a simple way of creating PLMs that
can quickly adapt to new languages. Concretely, by resetting the embedding
layer every K updates during pretraining, we encourage the PLM to improve its
ability of learning new embeddings within a limited number of updates, similar
to a meta-learning effect. Experiments with RoBERTa show that models pretrained
with our forgetting mechanism not only demonstrate faster convergence during
language adaptation but also outperform standard ones in a low-data regime,
particularly for languages that are distant from English.

<span><p>Dense vector representations for textual data are crucial in modern NLP. Word
embeddings and sentence embeddings estimated from raw texts are key in
achieving state-of-the-art results in various tasks requiring semantic
understanding. However, obtaining embeddings at the document level is
challenging due to computational requirements and lack of appropriate data.
Instead, most approaches fall back on computing document embeddings based on
sentence representations. Although there exist architectures and models to
encode documents fully, they are in general limited to English and few other
high-resourced languages. In this work, we provide a systematic comparison of
methods to produce document-level representations from sentences based on
LASER, LaBSE, and Sentence BERT pre-trained multilingual models. We compare
input token number truncation, sentence averaging as well as some simple
windowing and in some cases new augmented and learnable approaches, on 3 multi-
and cross-lingual tasks in 8 languages belonging to 3 different language
families. Our task-based extrinsic evaluations show that, independently of the
language, a clever combination of sentence embeddings is usually better than
encoding the full document as a single unit, even when this is possible. We
demonstrate that while a simple sentence average results in a strong baseline
for classification tasks, more complex combinations are necessary for semantic
tasks.

<span><p>Causal reasoning and logical reasoning are two important types of reasoning
abilities for human intelligence. However, their relationship has not been
extensively explored under machine intelligence context. In this paper, we
explore how the two reasoning abilities can be jointly modeled to enhance both
accuracy and explainability of machine learning models. More specifically, by
integrating two important types of reasoning ability -- counterfactual
reasoning and (neural) logical reasoning -- we propose Counterfactual
Collaborative Reasoning (CCR), which conducts counterfactual logic reasoning to
improve the performance. In particular, we use recommender system as an example
to show how CCR alleviate data scarcity, improve accuracy and enhance
transparency. Technically, we leverage counterfactual reasoning to generate
"difficult" counterfactual training examples for data augmentation, which --
together with the original training examples -- can enhance the model
performance. Since the augmented data is model irrelevant, they can be used to
enhance any model, enabling the wide applicability of the technique. Besides,
most of the existing data augmentation methods focus on "implicit data
augmentation" over users' implicit feedback, while our framework conducts
"explicit data augmentation" over users explicit feedback based on
counterfactual logic reasoning. Experiments on three real-world datasets show
that CCR achieves better performance than non-augmented models and implicitly
augmented models, and also improves model transparency by generating
counterfactual explanations.
