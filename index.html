<span><p>This work investigates the applicability of recent generative Large Language
Models (LLMs), such as the GPT series and Flan-T5, to ontology alignment for
identifying concept equivalence mappings across ontologies. To test the
zero-shot performance of Flan-T5-XXL and GPT-3.5-turbo, we leverage challenging
subsets from two equivalence matching datasets of the OAEI Bio-ML track, taking
into account concept labels and structural contexts. Preliminary findings
suggest that LLMs have the potential to outperform existing ontology alignment
systems like BERTMap, given careful framework and prompt design.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07251">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Despite their impressive performance in a wide range of NLP tasks, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have been reported to encode worrying-levels of gender
bias. Prior work has proposed debiasing methods that require human labelled
examples, data augmentation and fine-tuning of the LLMs, which are
computationally costly. Moreover, one might not even have access to the
internal parameters for performing debiasing such as in the case of
commercially available LLMs such as GPT-4. To address this challenge we propose
bias suppression, a novel alternative to debiasing that does not require access
to model parameters. We show that text-based preambles, generated from manually
designed templates covering counterfactual statements, can accurately suppress
gender biases in LLMs. Moreover, we find that descriptive sentences for
occupations can further suppress gender biases. Interestingly, we find that
bias suppression has a minimal adverse effect on downstream task performance,
while effectively mitigating the gender biases.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07311">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Most interpretability research in NLP focuses on understanding the behavior
and features of a fully trained model. However, certain insights into model
behavior may only be accessible by observing the trajectory of the training
process. In this paper, we present a case study of syntax acquisition in masked
language models (MLMs). Our findings demonstrate how analyzing the evolution of
interpretable artifacts throughout training deepens our understanding of
emergent behavior. In particular, we study Syntactic Attention Structure (SAS),
a naturally emerging property of MLMs wherein specific Transformer heads tend
to focus on specific syntactic relations. We identify a brief window in
training when models abruptly acquire SAS and find that this window is
concurrent with a steep drop in loss. Moreover, SAS precipitates the subsequent
acquisition of linguistic capabilities. We then examine the causal role of SAS
by introducing a regularizer to manipulate SAS during training, and demonstrate
that SAS is necessary for the development of grammatical capabilities. We
further find that SAS competes with other beneficial traits and capabilities
during training, and that briefly suppressing SAS can improve model quality.
These findings reveal a real-world example of the relationship between
disadvantageous simplicity bias and interpretable breakthrough training
dynamics.

<span><p>Transformers have significantly advanced the field of natural language
processing, but comprehending their internal mechanisms remains a challenge. In
this paper, we introduce a novel geometric perspective that elucidates the
inner mechanisms of transformer operations. Our primary contribution is
illustrating how layer normalization confines the latent features to a
hyper-sphere, subsequently enabling attention to mold the semantic
representation of words on this surface. This geometric viewpoint seamlessly
connects established properties such as iterative refinement and contextual
embeddings. We validate our insights by probing a pre-trained 124M parameter
GPT-2 model. Our findings reveal clear query-key attention patterns in early
layers and build upon prior observations regarding the subject-specific nature
of attention heads at deeper layers. Harnessing these geometric insights, we
present an intuitive understanding of transformers, depicting them as processes
that model the trajectory of word particles along the hyper-sphere.

<span><p>Attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) speech recognition model has been
widely successful in recent years. However, the joint optimization of acoustic

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07396">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Several prior studies have suggested that word frequency biases can cause the
Bert model to learn indistinguishable sentence embeddings. Contrastive learning
schemes such as SimCSE and ConSERT have already been adopted successfully in
unsupervised sentence embedding to improve the quality of embeddings by
reducing this bias. However, these methods still introduce new biases such as
sentence length bias and false negative sample bias, that hinders model's
ability to learn more fine-grained semantics. In this paper, we reexamine the
challenges of contrastive sentence embedding learning from a debiasing
perspective and argue that effectively eliminating the influence of various
biases is crucial for learning high-quality sentence embeddings. We think all
those biases are introduced by simple rules for constructing training data in
contrastive learning and the key for contrastive learning sentence embedding is
to mimic the distribution of training data in supervised machine learning in
unsupervised way. We propose a novel contrastive framework for sentence
embedding, termed DebCSE, which can eliminate the impact of these biases by an
inverse propensity weighted sampling method to select high-quality positive and
negative pairs according to both the surface and semantic similarity between
sentences. Extensive experiments on semantic textual similarity (STS)
benchmarks reveal that DebCSE significantly outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art models with an average Spearman's correlation coefficient of
80.33% on BERTbase.

<span><p>This thesis explores challenges in semantic parsing, specifically focusing on
scenarios with limited data and computational resources. It offers solutions
using techniques like automatic data curation, knowledge transfer, active

<p>For tasks with no parallel training data, the thesis proposes generating
synthetic training examples from structured database schemas. When there is
abundant data in a source domain but limited parallel data in a target domain,
knowledge from the source is leveraged to improve parsing in the target domain.
</p>
<p>For multilingual situations with limited data in the target languages, the
thesis introduces a method to adapt parsers using a limited human translation
budget. Active learning is applied to select source-language samples for manual
translation, maximizing parser performance in the target language. In addition,
an alternative method is also proposed to utilize machine translation services,
supplemented by human-translated data, to train a more effective parser.
</p>
<p>When computational resources are limited, a continual learning approach is

trade-offs between models and adaptation methods in addition to instances where
recent advances in LLMs may not lead to improved results. Further, in a

Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as Question Answering,

popular, due to the limitations of current evaluation techniques including the
lack of appropriate benchmarks, metrics, cost, and access to human annotators.
While LLMs are capable of handling approximately 100 languages, the majority of
languages beyond the top 20 lack systematic evaluation across various tasks,
metrics, and benchmarks. This creates an urgent need to scale up multilingual
evaluation to ensure a precise understanding of LLM performance across diverse
languages. LLM-based evaluators seem like the perfect solution to this problem,
as they do not require human annotators, human-created references, or
benchmarks and can theoretically be used to evaluate any language covered by
the LLM. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM-based evaluators can help
scale up multilingual evaluation. Specifically, we calibrate LLM-based
evaluation against 20k human judgments of five metrics across three
text-generation tasks in eight languages. Our findings indicate that LLM-based

<span><p>Implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR) aims at recognizing the

Recently, the prompt learning has just been applied to the IDRR task with great

the discrete nature of the state-art-of-art prompting approach requires manual
design of templates and answers, a big hurdle for its practical applications.
In this paper, we propose a continuous version of prompt learning together with
connective knowledge distillation, called AdaptPrompt, to reduce manual design
efforts via continuous prompting while further improving performance via
knowledge transfer. In particular, we design and train a few virtual tokens to
form continuous templates and automatically select the most suitable one by

feature high-quality annotation based on a well-developed linguistic theory and
include diverse and challenging test datasets, beyond the usual WSJ section 23

<span><p>Credibility signals represent a wide range of heuristics that are typically

Automating the task of credibility signal extraction, however, is very
challenging as it requires high-accuracy signal-specific extractors to be
trained, while there are currently no sufficiently large datasets annotated
with all credibility signals. This paper investigates whether large language
models (LLMs) can be prompted effectively with a set of 18 credibility signals
to produce weak labels for each signal. We then aggregate these potentially

demonstrate that our approach, which combines zero-shot LLM credibility signal
labeling and weak supervision, outperforms state-of-the-art classifiers on two
misinformation datasets without using any ground-truth labels for training. We
also analyse the contribution of the individual credibility signals towards
predicting content veracity, which provides new valuable insights into their

<span><p>Despite the success of neural models in solving reasoning tasks, their
compositional generalization capabilities remain unclear. In this work, we
propose a new setting of the structured explanation generation task to
facilitate compositional reasoning research. Previous works found that symbolic
methods achieve superior compositionality by using pre-defined inference rules
for iterative reasoning. But these approaches rely on brittle symbolic
transfers and are restricted to well-defined tasks. Hence, we propose a dynamic
modularized reasoning model, MORSE, to improve the compositional generalization
of neural models. MORSE factorizes the inference process into a combination of
modules, where each module represents a functional unit. Specifically, we adopt
modularized self-attention to dynamically select and route inputs to dedicated
heads, which specializes them to specific functions. We conduct experiments for
increasing lengths and shapes of reasoning trees on two benchmarks to test
MORSE's compositional generalization abilities, and find it outperforms
competitive baselines. Model ablation and deeper analyses show the

various rule-based or attention-based contextual biasing algorithms. However,
their performance might be sensitive to the biasing weight or degraded by
excessive attention to the named entity list, along with a risk of false

named entity recognition in conventional hybrid systems and the effective
decoupling of acoustic and linguistic information in the factorized neural

a proposed guide for ECA development. The results of the experiment with 90
participants show that users prefer to interact with the HECAs. The difference
between the two versions is statistically significant with a large effect size
(d=1.01), with many of the participants justifying their choice by saying that
the human-like characteristics of the HECA made the version more appealing.
This research provides key information on the potential effect of HECAs on
serious games, which can provide insight into the design of future mobile
serious games.

<span><p>Effectively leveraging multimodal information from social media posts is
essential to various downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, sarcasm
detection and hate speech classification. However, combining text and image
information is challenging because of the idiosyncratic cross-modal semantics
with hidden or complementary information present in matching image-text pairs.
In this work, we aim to directly model this by proposing the use of two
auxiliary losses jointly with the main task when fine-tuning any pre-trained
multimodal model. Image-Text Contrastive (ITC) brings image-text
representations of a post closer together and separates them from different
posts, capturing underlying dependencies. Image-Text Matching (ITM) facilitates
the understanding of semantic correspondence between images and text by
penalizing unrelated pairs. We combine these objectives with five multimodal
models, demonstrating consistent improvements across four popular social media
datasets. Furthermore, through detailed analysis, we shed light on the specific
scenarios and cases where each auxiliary task proves to be most effective.

<span><p>Recent breakthroughs in pre-trained code models, such as CodeBERT and Codex,
have shown their superior performance in various downstream tasks. The
correctness and unambiguity of API usage among these code models are crucial
for achieving desirable program functionalities, requiring them to learn
various API fully qualified names structurally and semantically. Recent studies
reveal that even state-of-the-art pre-trained code models struggle with
suggesting the correct APIs during code generation. However, the reasons for
such poor API usage performance are barely investigated. To address this
challenge, we propose using knowledge probing as a means of interpreting code
models, which uses cloze-style tests to measure the knowledge stored in models.
Our comprehensive study examines a code model's capability of understanding API
fully qualified names from two different perspectives: API call and API import.
Specifically, we reveal that current code models struggle with understanding
API names, with pre-training strategies significantly affecting the quality of
API name learning. We demonstrate that natural language context can assist code
models in locating Python API names and generalize Python API name knowledge to
unseen data. Our findings provide insights into the limitations and
capabilities of current pre-trained code models, and suggest that incorporating
API structure into the pre-training process can improve automated API usage and
code representations. This work provides significance for advancing code

<span><p>For a long time, humanity has pursued artificial intelligence (AI) equivalent
to or surpassing the human level, with AI agents considered a promising vehicle
for this pursuit. AI agents are artificial entities that sense their
environment, make decisions, and take actions. Many efforts have been made to
develop intelligent AI agents since the mid-20th century. However, these
efforts have mainly focused on advancement in algorithms or training strategies
to enhance specific capabilities or performance on particular tasks. Actually,
what the community lacks is a sufficiently general and powerful model to serve

large language models (LLMs) are regarded as potential sparks for Artificial
General Intelligence (AGI), offering hope for building general AI agents. Many
research efforts have leveraged LLMs as the foundation to build AI agents and
have achieved significant progress. We start by tracing the concept of agents
from its philosophical origins to its development in AI, and explain why LLMs
are suitable foundations for AI agents. Building upon this, we present a
conceptual framework for LLM-based agents, comprising three main components:
brain, perception, and action, and the framework can be tailored to suit
different applications. Subsequently, we explore the extensive applications of
LLM-based agents in three aspects: single-agent scenarios, multi-agent
scenarios, and human-agent cooperation. Following this, we delve into agent
societies, exploring the behavior and personality of LLM-based agents, the
social phenomena that emerge when they form societies, and the insights they

<span><p>Training large language models to follow instructions makes them perform
better on a wide range of tasks, generally becoming more helpful. However, a
perfectly helpful model will follow even the most malicious instructions and
readily generate harmful content. In this paper, we raise concerns over the
safety of models that only emphasize helpfulness, not safety, in their
instruction-tuning. We show that several popular instruction-tuned models are
highly unsafe. Moreover, we show that adding just 3% safety examples (a few
hundred demonstrations) in the training set when fine-tuning a model like LLaMA
can substantially improve their safety. Our safety-tuning does not make models
significantly less capable or helpful as measured by standard benchmarks.
However, we do find a behavior of exaggerated safety, where too much
safety-tuning makes models refuse to respond to reasonable prompts that
superficially resemble unsafe ones. Our study sheds light on trade-offs in
training LLMs to follow instructions and exhibit safe behavior.

<span><p>In-context learning (ICL) i.e. showing LLMs only a few task-specific
demonstrations has led to downstream gains with no task-specific fine-tuning
required. However, LLMs are sensitive to the choice of prompts, and therefore a
crucial research question is how to select good demonstrations for ICL. One
effective strategy is leveraging semantic similarity between the ICL
demonstrations and test inputs by using a text retriever, which however is
sub-optimal as that does not consider the LLM's existing knowledge about that
task. From prior work (Min et al., 2022), we already know that labels paired
with the demonstrations bias the model predictions. This leads us to our
hypothesis whether considering LLM's existing knowledge about the task,
especially with respect to the output label space can help in a better
demonstration selection strategy. Through extensive experimentation on three
text classification tasks, we find that it is beneficial to not only choose
semantically similar ICL demonstrations but also to choose those demonstrations
that help resolve the inherent label ambiguity surrounding the test example.
Interestingly, we find that including demonstrations that the LLM previously
mis-classified and also fall on the test example's decision boundary, brings
the most performance gain.

<span><p>Starting from the resurgence of deep learning, vision-language models (VLMs)
benefiting from large language models (LLMs) have never been so popular.
However, while LLMs can utilize extensive background knowledge and task
information with in-context learning, most VLMs still struggle with
understanding complex multi-modal prompts with multiple images. The issue can
traced back to the architectural design of VLMs or pre-training data.
Specifically, the current VLMs primarily emphasize utilizing multi-modal data
with a single image some, rather than multi-modal prompts with interleaved
multiple images and text. Even though some newly proposed VLMs could handle
user prompts with multiple images, pre-training data does not provide more
sophisticated multi-modal prompts than interleaved image and text crawled from
the web. We propose MMICL to address the issue by considering both the model
and data perspectives. We introduce a well-designed architecture capable of
seamlessly integrating visual and textual context in an interleaved manner and
MIC dataset to reduce the gap between the training data and the complex user
prompts in real-world applications, including: 1) multi-modal context with
interleaved images and text, 2) textual references for each image, and 3)
multi-image data with spatial, logical, or temporal relationships. Our
experiments confirm that MMICL achieves new stat-of-the-art zero-shot and
few-shot performance on a wide range of general vision-language tasks,
especially for complex reasoning benchmarks including MME and MMBench. Our
analysis demonstrates that MMICL effectively deals with the challenge of
complex multi-modal prompt understanding. The experiments on ScienceQA-IMG also

<span><p>Large language models are able to learn new tasks in context, where they are
provided with instructions and a few annotated examples. However, the
effectiveness of in-context learning is dependent on the provided context, and
the performance on a downstream task can vary considerably, depending on the
instruction. Importantly, such dependency on the context can surface in
unpredictable ways, e.g., a seemingly more informative instruction might lead
to a worse performance. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach,
which we term in-context probing. Similar to in-context learning, we
contextualize the representation of the input with an instruction, but instead
of decoding the output prediction, we probe the contextualized representation
to predict the label. Through a series of experiments on a diverse set of
classification tasks, we show that in-context probing is significantly more
robust to changes in instructions. We further show that probing performs

<summary class="article-expander__title">COVER: A Heuristic Greedy Adversarial Attack on Prompt-based Learning in Language Models. (arXiv:2306.05659v3 [cs.CL] UPDATED)</summary>
<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05659">

<span><p>Prompt-based learning has been proved to be an effective way in pre-trained
language models (PLMs), especially in low-resource scenarios like few-shot
settings. However, the trustworthiness of PLMs is of paramount significance and
potential vulnerabilities have been shown in prompt-based templates that could
mislead the predictions of language models, causing serious security concerns.
In this paper, we will shed light on some vulnerabilities of PLMs, by proposing
a prompt-based adversarial attack on manual templates in black box scenarios.
First of all, we design character-level and word-level heuristic approaches to
break manual templates separately. Then we present a greedy algorithm for the
attack based on the above heuristic destructive approaches. Finally, we
evaluate our approach with the classification tasks on three variants of BERT
series models and eight datasets. And comprehensive experimental results
justify the effectiveness of our approach in terms of attack success rate and
attack speed.

<span><p>The advent and fast development of neural networks have revolutionized the
research on dialogue systems and subsequently have triggered various challenges
regarding their automatic evaluation. Automatic evaluation of open-domain
dialogue systems as an open challenge has been the center of the attention of
many researchers. Despite the consistent efforts to improve automatic metrics'
correlations with human evaluation, there have been very few attempts to assess
their robustness over multiple domains and dimensions. Also, their focus is
mainly on the English language. All of these challenges prompt the development
of automatic evaluation metrics that are reliable in various domains,
dimensions, and languages. This track in the 11th Dialogue System Technology
Challenge (DSTC11) is part of the ongoing effort to promote robust and
multilingual automatic evaluation metrics. This article describes the datasets
and baselines provided to participants and discusses the submission and result

<summary class="article-expander__title">Mitigating Hallucination in Large Multi-Modal Models via Robust Instruction Tuning. (arXiv:2306.14565v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</summary>
<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14565">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Despite the promising progress in multi-modal tasks, current large
multi-modal models (LMM) are prone to hallucinating inconsistent descriptions
with respect to the associated image and human instructions. This paper
addresses this issue by introducing the first large and diverse visual
instruction tuning dataset, named Large-scale Robust Visual (LRV)-Instruction.
Our dataset consists of 120k visual instructions generated by GPT4, covering 16
vision-and-language tasks with open-ended instructions and answers. Unlike
existing studies that primarily focus on positive instruction samples, we
design LRV-Instruction to include both positive and negative instructions for
more robust visual instruction tuning. Our negative instructions are designed
at two semantic levels: (i) Nonexistent Element Manipulation and (ii) Existent
Element Manipulation. To efficiently measure the hallucination generated by
LMMs, we propose GPT4-Assisted Visual Instruction Evaluation (GAVIE), a novel
approach to evaluate visual instruction tuning without the need for
human-annotated groundtruth answers and can adapt to diverse instruction
formats. We conduct comprehensive experiments to investigate the hallucination
of LMMs. Our results demonstrate that existing LMMs exhibit significant
hallucination when presented with our negative instructions, particularly with
Existent Element Manipulation instructions. Moreover, by finetuning MiniGPT4 on
LRV-Instruction, we successfully mitigate hallucination while improving
performance on public datasets using less training data compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we observed that a balanced ratio of
positive and negative instances in the training data leads to a more robust
model. Updates of our project are available at

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>User experience (UX) is a part of human-computer interaction (HCI) research
and focuses on increasing intuitiveness, transparency, simplicity, and trust
for system users. Most of the UX research for machine learning (ML) or natural
language processing (NLP) focuses on a data-driven methodology, i.e., it fails
to focus on users' requirements, and engages domain users mainly for usability
evaluation. Moreover, more typical UX methods tailor the systems towards user
usability, unlike learning about the user needs first. The paper proposes a
methodology for integrating generative UX research into developing domain NLP
applications. Generative UX research employs domain users at the initial stages
of prototype development, i.e., ideation and concept evaluation, and the last
stage for evaluating the change in user value. In the case study, we report the
full-cycle prototype development of a domain-specific semantic search for daily
operations in the process industry. Our case study shows that involving domain
experts increases their interest and trust in the final NLP application.
Moreover, we show that synergetic UX+NLP research efficiently considers data-

<span><p>The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, enabling the generation of coherent and contextually
relevant human-like text. As LLMs increasingly power conversational agents used
by the general public world-wide, the synthetic personality embedded in these
models, by virtue of training on large amounts of human data, is becoming
increasingly important. Since personality is a key factor determining the
effectiveness of communication, we present a comprehensive method for
administering and validating personality tests on widely-used LLMs, as well as
for shaping personality in the generated text of such LLMs. Applying this
method, we found: 1) personality measurements in the outputs of some LLMs under
specific prompting configurations are reliable and valid; 2) evidence of
reliability and validity of synthetic LLM personality is stronger for larger
and instruction fine-tuned models; and 3) personality in LLM outputs can be
shaped along desired dimensions to mimic specific human personality profiles.
We discuss application and ethical implications of the measurement and shaping

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04408">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Open-sourced large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
efficacy in various tasks with instruction tuning. However, these models can
sometimes struggle with tasks that require more specialized knowledge such as
translation. One possible reason for such deficiency is that instruction tuning
aims to generate fluent and coherent text that continues from a given
instruction without being constrained by any task-specific requirements.
Moreover, it can be more challenging for tuning smaller LLMs with lower-quality
training data. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework using
examples in comparison to teach LLMs to learn translation. Our approach
involves presenting the model with examples of correct and incorrect
translations and using a preference loss to guide the model's learning. We
evaluate our method on WMT2022 test sets and show that it outperforms existing
methods. Our findings offer a new perspective on fine-tuning LLMs for
translation tasks and provide a promising solution for generating high-quality
translations. Please refer to Github for more details:

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10932">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>The enhancement of unsupervised learning of sentence representations has been
significantly achieved by the utility of contrastive learning. This approach
clusters the augmented positive instance with the anchor instance to create a
desired embedding space. However, relying solely on the contrastive objective
can result in sub-optimal outcomes due to its inability to differentiate subtle
semantic variations between positive pairs. Specifically, common data
augmentation techniques frequently introduce semantic distortion, leading to a
semantic margin between the positive pair. While the InfoNCE loss function
overlooks the semantic margin and prioritizes similarity maximization between
positive pairs during training, leading to the insensitive semantic
comprehension ability of the trained model. In this paper, we introduce a novel
Identical and Fraternal Twins of Contrastive Learning (named IFTCL) framework,
capable of simultaneously adapting to various positive pairs generated by
different augmentation techniques. We propose a \textit{Twins Loss} to preserve
the innate margin during training and promote the potential of data enhancement
in order to overcome the sub-optimal issue. We also present proof-of-concept
experiments combined with the contrastive objective to prove the validity of
the proposed Twins Loss. Furthermore, we propose a hippocampus queue mechanism
to restore and reuse the negative instances without additional calculation,
which further enhances the efficiency and performance of the IFCL. We verify
the IFCL framework on nine semantic textual similarity tasks with both English
and Chinese datasets, and the experimental results show that IFCL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

<span><p>The way we analyse clinical texts has undergone major changes over the last
years. The introduction of language models such as BERT led to adaptations for
the (bio)medical domain like PubMedBERT and ClinicalBERT. These models rely on
large databases of archived medical documents. While performing well in terms
of accuracy, both the lack of interpretability and limitations to transfer
across languages limit their use in clinical setting. We introduce a novel
light-weight graph-based embedding method specifically catering radiology
reports. It takes into account the structure and composition of the report,
while also connecting medical terms in the report through the multi-lingual
SNOMED Clinical Terms knowledge base. The resulting graph embedding uncovers
the underlying relationships among clinical terms, achieving a representation
that is better understandable for clinicians and clinically more accurate,
without reliance on large pre-training datasets. We show the use of this
embedding on two tasks namely disease classification of X-ray reports and image
classification. For disease classification our model is competitive with its
BERT-based counterparts, while being magnitudes smaller in size and training
data requirements. For image classification, we show the effectiveness of the
graph embedding leveraging cross-modal knowledge transfer and show how this

together by providing minimum information to the GPT model. We utilize
de-identified real-world clinical notes annotated for demographics, various

might provide text different from the text in the original data, we explore two
sets of evaluation metrics, including the traditional NER evaluation metrics

performance. Our results show that the GPT-3.5 method achieved an average of
0.975 F1 on demographics extraction, 0.615 F1 on social determinants

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>In our opinion the exuberance surrounding the relative success of data-driven
large language models (LLMs) is slightly misguided and for several reasons (i)
LLMs cannot be relied upon for factual information since for LLMs all ingested
text (factual or non-factual) was created equal; (ii) due to their subsymbolic
na-ture, whatever 'knowledge' these models acquire about language will always
be buried in billions of microfeatures (weights), none of which is meaningful
on its own; and (iii) LLMs will often fail to make the correct inferences in
several linguistic contexts (e.g., nominal compounds, copredication, quantifier
scope ambi-guities, intensional contexts. Since we believe the relative success
of data-driven large language models (LLMs) is not a reflection on the symbolic
vs. subsymbol-ic debate but a reflection on applying the successful strategy of
a bottom-up reverse engineering of language at scale, we suggest in this paper
applying the effective bottom-up strategy in a symbolic setting resulting in
symbolic, explainable, and ontologically grounded language models.
