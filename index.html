<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07793">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have ignited interest
in the temporal knowledge graph (tKG) domain, where conventional carefully
designed embedding-based and rule-based models dominate. The question remains
open of whether pre-trained LLMs can understand structured temporal relational
data and replace them as the foundation model for temporal relational
forecasting. Therefore, we bring temporal knowledge forecasting into the
generative setting. However, challenges occur in the huge chasms between
complex temporal graph data structure and sequential natural expressions LLMs
can handle, and between the enormous data sizes of tKGs and heavy computation
costs of finetuning LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
retrieval augmented generation framework that performs generative forecasting
on tKGs named GenTKG, which combines a temporal logical rule-based retrieval
strategy and lightweight parameter-efficient instruction tuning. Extensive
experiments have shown that GenTKG outperforms conventional methods of temporal
relational forecasting under low computation resources. GenTKG also highlights
remarkable transferability with exceeding performance on unseen datasets
without re-training. Our work reveals the huge potential of LLMs in the tKG
domain and opens a new frontier for generative forecasting on tKGs.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07795">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Fine-grained entity typing (FET) is the task of identifying specific entity
types at a fine-grained level for entity mentions based on their contextual
information. Conventional methods for FET require extensive human annotation,
which is time-consuming and costly. Recent studies have been developing weakly
supervised or zero-shot approaches. We study the setting of zero-shot FET where
only an ontology is provided. However, most existing ontology structures lack
rich supporting information and even contain ambiguous relations, making them
ineffective in guiding FET. Recently developed language models, though
promising in various few-shot and zero-shot NLP tasks, may face challenges in
zero-shot FET due to their lack of interaction with task-specific ontology. In
this study, we propose OnEFET, where we (1) enrich each node in the ontology
structure with two types of extra information: instance information for
training sample augmentation and topic information to relate types to contexts,
and (2) develop a coarse-to-fine typing algorithm that exploits the enriched
information by training an entailment model with contrasting topics and
instance-based augmented training samples. Our experiments show that OnEFET
achieves high-quality fine-grained entity typing without human annotation,
outperforming existing zero-shot methods by a large margin and rivaling
supervised methods.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07803">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>This article proposes a cognitive mechanism of humour of general
applicability, not restricted to verbal communication. It is indebted to
Raskin's concept of script overlap, and conforms to the incongruity-resolution
theoretical framework, but it is built on the notion of constraint, an abstract
correspondence between sets of data. Under this view, script overlap is an
outcome of a more abstractly described phenomenon, constraint overlap. The
important concept of the overlooked argument is introduced to characterise the
two overlapping constraints -- overt and covert. Their inputs and outputs are
not directly encoded in utterances, but implicated by them, and their overlap
results in another overlap at the level of the communicated utterances, that
the incongruity reveals. Our hypothesis assumes as a given that the evocation
of such constraints is a cognitive effect of the inferential process by which a
hearer interprets utterances. We base this assumption on Hofstadter's theory of
analogy-making as the essence of human thought. By substituting "stimuli" of
any kind for "utterances" in this model, we obtain a mechanism as easily
applicable to non-verbal communication -- slapstick, cartoons -- and we propose
it describes the necessary and sufficient conditions for a communicative act in
any modality to carry humour.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07815">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Semantic identifier (ID) is an important concept in information retrieval
that aims to preserve the semantics of objects such as documents and items
inside their IDs. Previous studies typically adopt a two-stage pipeline to
learn semantic IDs by first procuring embeddings using off-the-shelf text
encoders and then deriving IDs based on the embeddings. However, each step
introduces potential information loss and there is usually an inherent mismatch
between the distribution of embeddings within the latent space produced by text
encoders and the anticipated distribution required for semantic indexing.
Nevertheless, it is non-trivial to design a method that can learn the
document's semantic representations and its hierarchical structure
simultaneously, given that semantic IDs are discrete and sequentially
structured, and the semantic supervision is deficient. In this paper, we
introduce LMINDEXER, a self-supervised framework to learn semantic IDs with a
generative language model. We tackle the challenge of sequential discrete ID by
introducing a semantic indexer capable of generating neural sequential discrete
representations with progressive training and contrastive learning. In response
to the semantic supervision deficiency, we propose to train the model with a
self-supervised document reconstruction objective. The learned semantic indexer
can facilitate various downstream tasks, such as recommendation and retrieval.
We conduct experiments on three tasks including recommendation, product search,
and document retrieval on five datasets from various domains, where LMINDEXER
outperforms competitive baselines significantly and consistently.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07818">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Identifying analogies plays a pivotal role in human cognition and language
proficiency. In the last decade, there has been extensive research on word
analogies in the form of ``A is to B as C is to D.'' However, there is a
growing interest in analogies that involve longer text, such as sentences and
collections of sentences, which convey analogous meanings. While the current
NLP research community evaluates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
identify such analogies, the underlying reasons behind these abilities warrant
deeper investigation. Furthermore, the capability of LLMs to encode both
syntactic and semantic structures of language within their embeddings has
garnered significant attention with the surge in their utilization. In this
work, we examine the relationship between the abilities of multiple LLMs to
identify sentence analogies, and their capacity to encode syntactic and
semantic structures. Through our analysis, we find that analogy identification
ability of LLMs is positively correlated with their ability to encode syntactic
and semantic structures of sentences. Specifically, we find that the LLMs which
capture syntactic structures better, also have higher abilities in identifying
sentence analogies.

<a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07819">
<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>A common approach to explain NLP models, is to use importance measures that
express which tokens are important for a prediction. Unfortunately, such
explanations are often wrong despite being persuasive. Therefore, it is
essential to measure their faithfulness. One such metric is if tokens are truly
important, then masking them should result in worse model performance. However,
token masking introduces out-of-distribution issues and existing solutions are
computationally expensive and employ proxy-models. Furthermore, other metrics
are very limited in scope. In this work, we propose an inherently faithfulness
measurable model that addresses these challenges. This is achieved by using a
novel fine-tuning method that incorporates masking, such that masking tokens
become in-distribution by design. This differs from existing approaches, which
are completely model-agnostic but are inapplicable in practice. We demonstrate
the generality of our approach by applying it to various tasks and validate it
using statistical in-distribution tests. Additionally, because masking is
in-distribution, importance measures which themselves use masking become more
faithful, thus our model becomes more explainable.

<div class="article-summary-box-inner">
<span><p>Recent work has witnessed a paradigm shift from Seq2Seq to Seq2Edit in the
field of text editing, with the aim of addressing the slow autoregressive
inference problem posed by the former. Despite promising results, Seq2Edit
approaches still face several challenges such as inflexibility in generation
and difficulty in generalizing to other languages. In this work, we propose a
novel non-autoregressive text editing method to circumvent the above issues, by
modeling the edit process with latent CTC alignments. We make a crucial
extension to CTC by introducing the copy operation into the edit space, thus
enabling more efficient management of textual overlap in editing. We conduct
extensive experiments on GEC and sentence fusion tasks, showing that our
proposed method significantly outperforms existing Seq2Edit models and achieves
similar or even better results than Seq2Seq with over $4\times$ speedup.
Moreover, it demonstrates good generalizability on German and Russian. In-depth
analyses reveal the strengths of our method in terms of the robustness under
various scenarios and generating fluent and flexible outputs.

<span><p>One of the primary obstacles in the advancement of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) technologies for low-resource languages is the lack of
annotated datasets for training and testing machine learning models. In this
paper, we present Antarlekhaka, a tool for manual annotation of a comprehensive
set of tasks relevant to NLP. The tool is Unicode-compatible,
language-agnostic, Web-deployable and supports distributed annotation by
multiple simultaneous annotators. The system sports user-friendly interfaces
for 8 categories of annotation tasks. These, in turn, enable the annotation of
a considerably larger set of NLP tasks. The task categories include two
linguistic tasks not handled by any other tool, namely, sentence boundary
detection and deciding canonical word order, which are important tasks for text
that is in the form of poetry. We propose the idea of sequential annotation
based on small text units, where an annotator performs several tasks related to
a single text unit before proceeding to the next unit. The research
applications of the proposed mode of multi-task annotation are also discussed.
Antarlekhaka outperforms other annotation tools in objective evaluation. It has
been also used for two real-life annotation tasks on two different languages,
namely, Sanskrit and Bengali. The tool is available at

<span><p>In this work, we revisit existing oracle generation studies plus ChatGPT to

state-of-the-art test oracle generation models on five NLG-based and two test
adequacy metrics for our analysis. We apply two different correlation analyses
between these two different sets of metrics. Surprisingly, we found no
significant correlation between the NLG-based metrics and test adequacy

activemq-artemis had the highest performance on all the NLG-based metrics among
the studied NOGs, however, it had the most number of projects with a decrease
in test adequacy metrics compared to all the studied NOGs. We further conduct a
qualitative analysis to explore the reasons behind our observations, we found
that oracles with high NLG-based metrics but low test adequacy metrics tend to
have complex or multiple chained method invocations within the oracle's
parameters, making it hard for the model to generate completely, affecting the
test adequacy metrics. On the other hand, oracles with low NLG-based metrics
but high test adequacy metrics tend to have to call different assertion types
or a different method that functions similarly to the ones in the ground truth.
Overall, this work complements prior studies on test oracle generation with an
extensive performance evaluation with both NLG and test adequacy metrics and
provides guidelines for better assessment of deep learning applications in

finetune a pretrained language model to select an action, based on the current
view and the trajectory history, that would best fulfill the navigation
instructions. In contrast to the standard setup which adapts a pretrained
language model to work directly with continuous visual features from pretrained
vision models, our approach instead uses (discrete) language as the perceptual
representation. We explore two use cases of our language-based navigation
(LangNav) approach on the R2R vision-and-language navigation benchmark:
generating synthetic trajectories from a prompted large language model (GPT-4)
with which to finetune a smaller language model; and sim-to-real transfer where
we transfer a policy learned on a simulated environment (ALFRED) to a
real-world environment (R2R). Our approach is found to improve upon strong
baselines that rely on visual features in settings where only a few gold

<span><p>Recent theoretical work has identified surprisingly simple reasoning
problems, such as checking if two nodes in a graph are connected or simulating
finite-state machines, that are provably unsolvable by standard transformers
that answer immediately after reading their input. However, in practice,
transformers' reasoning can be improved by allowing them to use a "chain of
thought" or "scratchpad", i.e., generate and condition on a sequence of
intermediate tokens before answering. Motivated by this, we ask: Does such
intermediate generation fundamentally extend the computational power of a
decoder-only transformer? We show that the answer is yes, but the amount of
increase depends crucially on the amount of intermediate generation. For
instance, we find that transformer decoders with a logarithmic number of
decoding steps (w.r.t. the input length) push the limits of standard
transformers only slightly, while a linear number of decoding steps adds a
clear new ability (under standard complexity conjectures): recognizing all
regular languages. Our results also imply that linear steps keep transformer
decoders within context-sensitive languages, and polynomial steps make them
recognize exactly the class of polynomial-time solvable problems -- the first
exact characterization of a type of transformers in terms of standard
complexity classes. Together, our results provide a nuanced framework for
understanding how the length of a transformer's chain of thought or scratchpad

<span><p>Analytical theories suggest that higher-quality data can lead to lower test
errors in models trained on a fixed data budget. Moreover, a model can be
trained on a lower compute budget without compromising performance if a dataset
can be stripped of its redundancies. Coreset selection (or data pruning) seeks
to select a subset of the training data so as to maximize the performance of
models trained on this subset, also referred to as coreset. There are two
dominant approaches: (1) geometry-based data selection for maximizing data
diversity in the coreset, and (2) functions that assign difficulty scores to
samples based on training dynamics. Optimizing for data diversity leads to a
coreset that is biased towards easier samples, whereas, selection by difficulty
ranking omits easy samples that are necessary for the training of deep learning
models. This demonstrates that data diversity and importance scores are two
complementary factors that need to be jointly considered during coreset
selection. We represent a dataset as an undirected graph and propose a novel
pruning algorithm, D2 Pruning, that uses forward and reverse message passing
over this dataset graph for coreset selection. D2 Pruning updates the
difficulty scores of each example by incorporating the difficulty of its
neighboring examples in the dataset graph. Then, these updated difficulty
scores direct a graph-based sampling method to select a coreset that
encapsulates both diverse and difficult regions of the dataset space. We
evaluate supervised and self-supervised versions of our method on various
vision and language datasets. Results show that D2 Pruning improves coreset
selection over previous state-of-the-art methods for up to 70% pruning rates.

<span><p>One of the prominent problems with processing and operating on text data is
the non uniformity of it. Due to the change in the dialects and languages, the
caliber of translation is low. This creates a unique problem while using NLP in
text data; which is the spell variation arising from the inconsistent
translations and transliterations. This problem can also be further aggravated
by the human error arising from the various ways to write a Proper Noun from an
Indian language into its English equivalent. Translating proper nouns
originating from Indian languages can be complicated as some proper nouns are
also used as common nouns which might be taken literally. Applications of NLP
that require addresses, names and other proper nouns face this problem
frequently. We propose a method to cluster these spell variations for proper
nouns using ML techniques and mathematical similarity equations. We aimed to
use Affinity Propagation to determine relative similarity between the tokens.
The results are augmented by filtering the token-variation pair by a similarity
threshold. We were able to reduce the spell variations by a considerable
amount. This application can significantly reduce the amount of human
annotation efforts needed for data cleansing and formatting.

<span><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in NLP, but their demands hinder their
widespread deployment. While Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) offers a
solution, its extensive training costs make Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) a
more practical approach for LLMs. In existing studies, activation outliers in
particular channels are identified as the bottleneck to PTQ accuracy. They
propose to transform the magnitudes from activations to weights, which however
offers limited alleviation or suffers from unstable gradients, resulting in a
severe performance drop at low-bitwidth. In this paper, we propose QLLM, an
accurate and efficient low-bitwidth PTQ method designed for LLMs. QLLM
introduces an adaptive channel reassembly technique that reallocates the
magnitude of outliers to other channels, thereby mitigating their impact on the
quantization range. This is achieved by channel disassembly and channel
assembly, which first breaks down the outlier channels into several
sub-channels to ensure a more balanced distribution of activation magnitudes.
Then similar channels are merged to maintain the original channel number for
efficiency. Additionally, an adaptive strategy is designed to autonomously
determine the optimal number of sub-channels for channel disassembly. To
further compensate for the performance loss caused by quantization, we propose
an efficient tuning method that only learns a small number of low-rank weights
while freezing the pre-trained quantized model. After training, these low-rank
parameters can be fused into the frozen weights without affecting inference.
Extensive experiments on LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 show that QLLM can obtain accurate
quantized models efficiently. For example, QLLM quantizes the 4-bit LLaMA-2-70B
within 10 hours on a single A100-80G GPU, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art method by 7.89% on the average accuracy across five zero-shot

<span><p>Recently, contrastive learning has become a key component in fine-tuning code
search models for software development efficiency and effectiveness. It pulls
together positive code snippets while pushing negative samples away given
search queries. Among contrastive learning, InfoNCE is the most widely used
loss function due to its better performance. However, the following problems in
negative samples of InfoNCE may deteriorate its representation learning: 1) The
existence of false negative samples in large code corpora due to duplications.
2). The failure to explicitly differentiate between the potential relevance of
negative samples. As an example, a bubble sorting algorithm example is less
``negative'' than a file saving function for the quick sorting algorithm query.
In this paper, we tackle the above problems by proposing a simple yet effective
Soft-InfoNCE loss that inserts weight terms into InfoNCE. In our proposed loss
function, we apply three methods to estimate the weights of negative pairs and
show that the vanilla InfoNCE loss is a special case of Soft-InfoNCE.
Theoretically, we analyze the effects of Soft-InfoNCE on controlling the

it difficult to test performance on unseen domains. Furthermore, most existing

<span><p>Plan-and-Write is a common hierarchical approach in long-form narrative text
generation, which first creates a plan to guide the narrative writing.
Following this approach, several studies rely on simply prompting large
language models for planning, which often yields suboptimal results. In this
paper, we propose a new framework called Evaluation-guided Iterative Plan
Extraction for long-form narrative text generation (EIPE-text), which extracts
plans from the corpus of narratives and utilizes the extracted plans to
construct a better planner. EIPE-text has three stages: plan extraction,
learning, and inference. In the plan extraction stage, it iteratively extracts
and improves plans from the narrative corpus and constructs a plan corpus. We
propose a question answer (QA) based evaluation mechanism to automatically
evaluate the plans and generate detailed plan refinement instructions to guide
the iterative improvement. In the learning stage, we build a better planner by
fine-tuning with the plan corpus or in-context learning with examples in the
plan corpus. Finally, we leverage a hierarchical approach to generate long-form
narratives. We evaluate the effectiveness of EIPE-text in the domains of novels
and storytelling. Both GPT-4-based evaluations and human evaluations
demonstrate that our method can generate more coherent and relevant long-form
narratives. Our code will be released in the future.

<span><p>Large language models (LLMs) often make factually incorrect responses despite
their success in various applications. In this paper, we hypothesize that

LLMs are vulnerable to the co-occurrence bias, defined as preferring frequently
co-occurred words over the correct answer. Consequently, LLMs struggle to
recall facts whose subject and object rarely co-occur in the pre-training
dataset although they are seen during finetuning. We show that co-occurrence
bias remains despite scaling up model sizes or finetuning. Therefore, we
suggest finetuning on a debiased dataset to mitigate the bias by filtering out
biased samples whose subject-object co-occurrence count is high. Although
debiased finetuning allows LLMs to memorize rare facts in the training set, it
is not effective in recalling rare facts unseen during finetuning. Further
research in mitigation will help build reliable language models by preventing

Processing. However, these models have long inference latency, which limits

generative tasks, as models need to run iteratively to generate tokens
sequentially without leveraging token-level parallelization. To address this,
we propose Big Little Decoder (BiLD), a framework that can improve inference

BiLD framework contains two models with different sizes that collaboratively
generate text. The small model runs autoregressively to generate text with a
low inference cost, and the large model is only invoked occasionally to refine
the small model's inaccurate predictions in a non-autoregressive manner. To
coordinate the small and large models, BiLD introduces two simple yet effective
policies: (1) the fallback policy that determines when to hand control over to
the large model; and (2) the rollback policy that determines when the large
model needs to correct the small model's inaccurate predictions. To evaluate
our framework across different tasks and models, we apply BiLD to various text

mechanisms of backdoored language models and how they process trigger inputs,
e.g., when switching to toxic language, has yet to be found. In this work, we
study the internal representations of transformer-based backdoored language
models and determine early-layer MLP modules as most important for the backdoor
mechanism in combination with the initial embedding projection. We use this
knowledge to remove, insert, and modify backdoor mechanisms with engineered
replacements that reduce the MLP module outputs to essentials for the backdoor
mechanism. To this end, we introduce PCP ablation, where we replace transformer
modules with low-rank matrices based on the principal components of their
activations. We demonstrate our results on backdoored toy, backdoored large,
and non-backdoored open-source models. We show that we can improve the backdoor
robustness of large language models by locally constraining individual modules
during fine-tuning on potentially poisonous data sets.

<span><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
and demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks. Unfortunately, they
are prone to hallucinations, where the model exposes incorrect or false
information in its responses, which renders diligent evaluation approaches
mandatory. While LLM performance in specific knowledge fields is often
evaluated based on question and answer (Q&amp;A) datasets, such evaluations usually
report only a single accuracy number for the dataset, which often covers an
entire field. This field-based evaluation, is problematic with respect to
transparency and model improvement. A stratified evaluation could instead
reveal subfields, where hallucinations are more likely to occur and thus help
to better assess LLMs' risks and guide their further development. To support
such stratified evaluations, we propose LLMMaps as a novel visualization
technique that enables users to evaluate LLMs' performance with respect to Q&amp;A
datasets. LLMMaps provide detailed insights into LLMs' knowledge capabilities
in different subfields, by transforming Q&amp;A datasets as well as LLM responses
into an internal knowledge structure. An extension for comparative
visualization furthermore, allows for the detailed comparison of multiple LLMs.
To assess LLMMaps we use them to conduct a comparative analysis of several
state-of-the-art LLMs, such as BLOOM, GPT-2, GPT-3, ChatGPT and LLaMa-13B, as
well as two qualitative user evaluations. All necessary source code and data
for generating LLMMaps to be used in scientific publications and elsewhere is

challenging yet answerable questions accompanied by reasoning chains as

Experiments show that ChatGPT is not a good causal reasoner, but a good causal
explainer. Besides, ChatGPT has a serious hallucination on causal reasoning,
possibly due to the reporting biases between causal and non-causal
relationships in natural language, as well as ChatGPT's upgrading processes,
such as RLHF. The In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

causal reasoning ability of ChatGPT is sensitive to the words used to express
the causal concept in prompts, and close-ended prompts perform better than

explicit causality rather than implicit causality, and performs better in

<span><p>Prior work has combined chain-of-thought prompting in large language models
(LLMs) with programmatic representations to perform effective and transparent
reasoning. While such an approach works well for tasks that only require
forward reasoning (e.g., straightforward arithmetic), it is less effective for
constraint solving problems that require more sophisticated planning and
search. In this paper, we propose a new satisfiability-aided language modeling
(SatLM) approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We use an
LLM to generate a declarative task specification rather than an imperative
program and leverage an off-the-shelf automated theorem prover to derive the
final answer. This approach has two key advantages. The declarative
specification is closer to the problem description than the reasoning steps
are, so the LLM can parse it out of the description more accurately.
Furthermore, by offloading the actual reasoning task to an automated theorem
prover, our approach can guarantee the correctness of the answer with respect
to the parsed specification and avoid planning errors in the solving process.
We evaluate SATLM on 8 different datasets and show that it consistently
outperforms program-aided LMs in the imperative paradigm. In particular, SATLM
outperforms program-aided LMs by 23% on a challenging subset of the GSM
arithmetic reasoning dataset; SATLM also achieves a new SoTA on LSAT and

<span><p>Multilingual language model (LM) have become a powerful tool in NLP
especially for non-English languages. Nevertheless, model parameters of
multilingual LMs remain large due to the larger embedding matrix of the

LMs can be trained in a target language with the language-specific vocabulary
only, but this requires a large budget and availability of reliable corpora to
achieve a high-quality LM from scratch. In this paper, we propose
vocabulary-trimming (VT), a method to reduce a multilingual LM vocabulary to a
target language by deleting irrelevant tokens from its vocabulary. In theory,
VT can compress any existing multilingual LM to build monolingual LMs in any
language covered by the multilingual LM. In our experiments, we show that VT
can retain the original performance of the multilingual LM, while being smaller
in size (in general around 50% of the original vocabulary size is enough) than
the original multilingual LM. The evaluation is performed over four NLP tasks
(two generative and two classification tasks) among four widely used
multilingual LMs in seven languages. Finally, we show that this methodology can
keep the best of both monolingual and multilingual worlds by keeping a small
size as monolingual models without the need for specifically retraining them,

Second, when adjusting for labeling biases through randomized answer ordering,
models across the board trend towards uniformly random survey responses. In

This paper investigates the distillation of visual representations in large

and carefully promoting better coherence in vision-language alignment with the
teacher; (2) by enriching the teacher's language representations with
informative and finegrained semantic attributes to effectively distinguish
between different labels. We propose several metrics and conduct extensive

various voices to convey diverse information. Compared to traditional
text-to-speech (TTS) methods relying on speech prompts (reference speech) for
voice variability, using text prompts (descriptions) is more user-friendly
since speech prompts can be hard to find or may not exist at all. TTS
approaches based on the text prompt face two main challenges: 1) the
one-to-many problem, where not all details about voice variability can be
described in the text prompt, and 2) the limited availability of text prompt
datasets, where vendors and large cost of data labeling are required to write
text prompts for speech. In this work, we introduce PromptTTS 2 to address
these challenges with a variation network to provide variability information of
voice not captured by text prompts, and a prompt generation pipeline to utilize
the large language models (LLM) to compose high quality text prompts.
Specifically, the variation network predicts the representation extracted from
the reference speech (which contains full information about voice variability)
based on the text prompt representation. For the prompt generation pipeline, it
generates text prompts for speech with a speech language understanding model to
recognize voice attributes (e.g., gender, speed) from speech and a large
language model to formulate text prompts based on the recognition results.
Experiments on a large-scale (44K hours) speech dataset demonstrate that
compared to the previous works, PromptTTS 2 generates voices more consistent
with text prompts and supports the sampling of diverse voice variability,
thereby offering users more choices on voice generation. Additionally, the

promising results across various tasks and models for parameter-efficient

maintains competitive performance with fewer trainable parameters and does not
drastically scale up its parameters as the model size expands. However, PT
introduces additional soft prompt tokens, leading to longer input sequences,
which significantly impacts training and inference time and memory usage due to
the Transformer's quadratic complexity. Particularly concerning for Large
Language Models (LLMs) that face heavy daily querying. To address this issue,
we propose Decomposed Prompt Tuning (DePT), which decomposes the soft prompt
into a shorter soft prompt and a pair of low-rank matrices that are then
optimised with two different learning rates. This allows DePT to achieve better
performance while saving over 20% memory and time costs compared to vanilla PT

with single-turn exchanges, neglecting the nuanced interactions among the user,
LLMs, and external tools, while also underestimating the importance of natural
language feedback from users. These oversights contribute to discrepancies
between research benchmark evaluations and real-world use cases. We introduce
MINT, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs' ability to solve tasks with multi-turn
interactions by (1) using tools and (2) leveraging natural language feedback.
To ensure reproducibility, we provide an evaluation framework where LLMs can
access tools by executing Python code and receive users' natural language
feedback simulated by GPT-4. We repurpose a diverse set of established
evaluation datasets focusing on reasoning, coding, and decision-making and
carefully curate them into a compact subset for efficient evaluation. Our
analysis of 20 open- and closed-source LLMs offers intriguing findings. (a)
LLMs generally benefit from tools and language feedback, with performance gains
(absolute, same below) of 1-8% for each turn of tool use and 2-17% with natural
language feedback. (b) Better single-turn performance does not guarantee better
multi-turn performance. (c) Surprisingly, on the LLMs evaluated, supervised
instruction-finetuning (SIFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF) generally hurt multi-turn capabilities. We expect MINT can help measure
progress and incentivize research in improving LLMs' capabilities in multi-turn
interactions, especially for open-source communities where multi-turn human
evaluation can be less accessible compared to commercial LLMs with a larger
user base.

<span><p>Recent research in decoding methods for Natural Language Generation (NLG)
tasks has shown that MAP decoding is not optimal, because model probabilities
do not always align with human preferences. Stronger decoding methods,
including Quality Estimation (QE) reranking and Minimum Bayes' Risk (MBR)
decoding, have since been proposed to mitigate the model-perplexity-vs-quality
mismatch. While these decoding methods achieve state-of-the-art performance,
they are prohibitively expensive to compute. In this work, we propose MBR
finetuning and QE finetuning which distill the quality gains from these
decoding methods at training time, while using an efficient decoding algorithm
at inference time. Using the canonical NLG task of Neural Machine Translation
(NMT), we show that even with self-training, these finetuning methods
significantly outperform the base model. Moreover, when using an external LLM
as a teacher model, these finetuning methods outperform finetuning on
human-generated references. These findings suggest new ways to leverage
monolingual data to achieve improvements in model quality that are on par with,
or even exceed, improvements from human-curated data, while maintaining maximum

However, in scenarios where LLMs serve as intelligent agents, as seen in

the reward model often finds shortcuts to bypass its intended objectives,
misleadingly assuming that humans prefer longer responses. The emergence of

<span><p>With the success of large-scale pretraining in NLP, there is an increasing
trend of applying it to the domain of life sciences. In particular, pretraining
methods based on DNA sequences have garnered growing attention due to their
potential to capture generic information about genes. However, existing
pretraining methods for DNA sequences largely rely on direct adoptions of BERT
pretraining from NLP, lacking a comprehensive understanding and a specifically
tailored approach. To address this research gap, we first conducted a series of
exploratory experiments and gained several insightful observations: 1) In the
fine-tuning phase of downstream tasks, when using K-mer overlapping
tokenization instead of K-mer non-overlapping tokenization, both overlapping
and non-overlapping pretraining weights show consistent performance
improvement.2) During the pre-training process, using K-mer overlapping
tokenization quickly produces clear K-mer embeddings and reduces the loss to a
very low level, while using K-mer non-overlapping tokenization results in less
distinct embeddings and continuously decreases the loss. 3) Using overlapping
tokenization causes the self-attention in the intermediate layers of
pre-trained models to tend to overly focus on certain tokens, reflecting that
these layers are not adequately optimized. In summary, overlapping tokenization
can benefit the fine-tuning of downstream tasks but leads to inadequate
pretraining with fast convergence. To unleash the pretraining potential, we
introduce a novel approach called RandomMask, which gradually increases the
task difficulty of BERT-like pretraining by continuously expanding its mask
boundary, forcing the model to learn more knowledge. RandomMask is simple but
effective, achieving top-tier performance across 26 datasets of 28 datasets
